        "Sanwit: I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.",
        "Sahwit: I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.",
        "Sahwit: I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.",
        "Sahwit: Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.",
        "Sahwit: Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!",
        "Witness: Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!",
        "Sanwit: Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!",
        "Phoenix: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Ho",
        "Judge: How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...?",
        "Phoenix: They aren't, are they...",
        "Judge: Not at all.",
        "Judge: Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.",
        "Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)",
        "Sahwit: I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.",
        "Phoenix: So, you didn't touch ANYTHING in the apartment?",
        "Sahwit: Um, yes. I mean no! Nothing.",
        "Phoenix: Okay. What happened next?",
        "Sahwit: I thought to call the police immediately!",
        "Sahwit: However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.",
        "(No character name visible): However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.",
        "Phoenix: The phone in her apartment wasn't working?",
        "Sahwit: Yes. I mean, no. No, it wasn't. Right.",
        "Phoenix: But you said you didn't go into the apartment... or did you!?",
        "Sahwit: Oh, oh, that? I can explain that!",
        "Sahwit: There was a cordless phone on a shelf in the entranceway.",
        "Sahwit: I reached inside and tried using that to call...",
        "Payne: And that phone wasn't working, correct?",
        "Payne: What happened next?",
        "Sahwit: I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.",
        "Sahwit: I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.",
        "SANWIT: I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.",
        "Sanwit: I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.",
        "Phoenix: You found the body at 1:00 PM. You're sure?",
        "Sahwit: Yes. It was 1:00 PM, for certain.",
        "Phoenix: Frankly, I find that hard to believe!",
        "Phoenix: Your statement directly contradicts the autopsy report.",
        "Phoenix: The autopsy notes the time of death at sometime after 4PM.",
        "Phoenix: There was nobody to... er... no \"body\" to find at 1:00 PM!",
        "Phoenix: How do you explain this three-hour gap?",
        "Sahwit: !!!",
        "Sahwit: Oh, that! Oh, er...",
        "Payne: This is trivial! The witness merely forgot the time!",
        "Judge: After his testimony, I find that hard to believe.",
        "Judge: Mr. Sahwit...",
        "Judge: Why were you so certain that you found the body at 1:00 PM?",
        "Sahwit: I... er... well, I... Gee, that's a really good question!",
        "Mia: Great job, Wright! Way to put him on the spot!",
        "Mia: That's all you have to do: point out contradictions!",
        "Mia: Lies always beget more lies!",
        "Mia: See through one, and their whole story falls apart!",
        "Sahwit: Wait! I remember now!",
        "Judge: Would you care to give your testimony again?",
        "Sahwit: You see, when I found the body, I heard the time.",
        "Sahwit: There was a voice saying the time... It was probably coming from the television.",
        "Sahwit: Oh, but it was three hours off, wasn't it?",
        "Sahwit: I guess the victim must have been watching a video of a taped program!",
        "Sahwit: That's why I thought it was 1:00 PM!",
        "Sahwit: Terribly sorry about the misunderstanding...",
        "Judge: Hmm... I see.",
        "Judge: Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.",
        "Mia: Wright!",
        "Mia: You know what to do!",
        "Phoenix: I've got this one.",
        "Sanwit: You see, when I found the body, I heard the time.",
        "SANWIT: You see, when I found the body, I heard the time.",
        "Phoenix: Your Honor! That statement",
        "Judge: ...?",
        "Judge: It does? I don't see anything contradictory...",
        "Phoenix: Huh? Really?",
        "Judge: Objection overruled.",
        "Judge: Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!",
        "Phoenix: (Whoops! That didn't go so well.)",
        "SAHWIT: You see, when I found the body, I heard the time.",
        "Phoenix: Hold it right there!",
        "Phoenix: The prosecution has said there was a blackout at the time of the discovery!",
        "Phoenix: And this record proves it!",
        "Sahwit: ...!",
        "Phoenix: You couldn't have heard a television... or a video!",
        "Sahwit: Gah!!!",
        "Sahwit: I... well... urk!",
        "Judge: The defense has a point.",
        "Judge: Do you have an explanation for this, Mr. Sahwit?",
        "Sahwit: No, I... I find it quite puzzling myself! Quite!",
        "Sahwit: ...",
        "Sahwit: W-wait! I remember now!",
        "Judge: Mr. Sahwit?",
        "Judge: The court would prefer to hear an accurate testimony from the very beginning.",
        "Judge: These constant corrections are harming your credibility.",
        "Judge: That, and you seem rather... distraught.",
        "Sahwit: M-my apologies, Your Honor!",
        "Sahwit: It... er, it must have been the shock of finding the body!",
        "Judge: Very well, Mr. Sahwit.",
        "Judge: Let's hear your testimony once more please.",
        "Sahwit: Actually, I didn't \"hear\" the time... I \"saw\" it!",
        "Sahwit: There was a table clock in the apartment, wasn't there!",
        "Sahwit: Yeah, the murder weapon! The killer used it to hit the victim!",
        "Sahwit: That must have been what I saw.",
        "Judge: You saw a clock? I guess that would explain it.",
        "Judge: The defense may cross-examine the witness.",
        "Phoenix: Gladly.",
        "Sanwit: Actually, I didn't \"hear\" the time... I \"saw\" it!",
        "Phoenix: That strikes me as a very suspicious mistake.",
        "Sahwit: Yes, I can see how you'd be a little doubtful...",
        "Sahwit: I'm really sorry. I only just remembered that table clock!",
        "Judge: A \"table clock\"?",
        "SANWIT: There was a table clock in the apartment, wasn't there!",
        "Sanwit: There was a table clock in the apartment, wasn't there!",
        "Phoenix: Wait just a moment!",
        "Phoenix: The murder weapon wasn't a clock. It was this statue!",
        "Phoenix: Now how is this supposed to be a clock?",
        "Sahwit: Y-you with your \"objections,\" and your \"evidence\"... Just who do you think you are",
        "Phoenix: Just answer the question, Mr. Sahwit.",
        "Sahwit: Hey, I... I saw it there, okay! That's a clock!",
        "PAYNE: Your Honor! If I may...",
        "Judge: Yes, Mr. Payne?",
        "Payne: As the witness stated, this statue is indeed a clock.",
        "Payne: The neck is a switch. You just tilt it, and it says the time out loud.",
        "Payne: As it doesn't look like a clock, I submitted it as a statue. My apologies.",
        "Judge: I see.",
        "Judge: So the murder weapon was a table clock after all.",
        "Judge: Well, Mr. Wright?",
        "Judge: It appears that the witness's testimony was correct. This is a clock.",
        "Judge: Do you have any problems with his testimony now?",
        "Phoenix: I guess not.",
        "Phoenix: Your Honor, there is a gaping hole in the witness's testimony!",
        "Phoenix: The only way he could have known the weapon was a clock is to hold it in his hand.",
        "Phoenix: Yet the witness testified that he never entered the apartment!",
        "Phoenix: Clearly, a contradiction!",
        "Judge: Hmm... indeed!",
        "Phoenix: The witness knew it was a clock, because he...",
        "Phoenix: Tell me, isn't it true that you knew the victim?",
        "Phoenix: You're lying!",
        "Phoenix: You were inside the apartment on the day of the murder!",
        "Sahwit: Oh yeah? Prove it! Prove I went in there!",
        "Phoenix: I'll do better than that! I can prove you were the one who killed her!",
        "Phoenix: You struck her with the clock, and the shock of the blow triggered the clock's voice!",
        "Phoenix: That was the sound you heard!",
        "Judge: Order in the court!",
        "Judge: Intriguing. Please continue, Mr. Wright.",
        "Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor.",
        "Phoenix: Mr. Sahwit.",
        "Phoenix: The sound must have left quite an impression on you.",
        "Phoenix: Understandable, since the murder weapon spoke just as you hit t",
        "Phoenix: That voice was burned into your mind.",
        "Phoenix: That's why you were so certain about the time!",
        "Payne: W-w-what's the meaning of this?",
        "Payne: This is all baseless conjecture!",
        "Phoenix: Baseless...?",
        "Judge: Would the witness care to elaborate?",
        "Judge: Did you strike the victim with the clock?",
        "Sahwit: I... I...! That... that day... I... I never!",
        "Sahwit: [No visible dialog text in the image]",
        "Sahwit: I-it was him, I tell you! I saw him!",
        "Sahwit: H-he killed her and he should burn! Burn! Give him death!",
        "Judge: Order! Order in the",
        "PAYNE: Your Honor, a-a moment please!",
        "Payne: There isn't a shred of evidence supporting the defense's claims!",
        "Judge: Mr. Wright!",
        "Phoenix: Your Honor?",
        "Judge: You claim the sound the witness heard came from the clock...",
        "Judge: Do you have any evidence?",
        "Phoenix: (The whole case is riding on this! I'd better think it through carefully!)",
        "Phoenix: Y-Your Honor.",
        "Phoenix: The sound Mr. Sahwit heard was definitely this clock.",
        "Phoenix: A fact which is clear if you simply...",
        "Phoenix: Let's sound the clock now, here in this court.",
        "Phoenix: Your Honor, may I have the clock?",
        "Phoenix: I ask the court to listen very carefully...",
        "Judge: That certainly is a strange way to announ",
        "Phoenix: Well, he is \"The Thinker,\" after all.",
        "Judge: So, we've heard the clock. What are your conclusions, Mr. Wright?",
        "Phoenix: Mr. Payne... can you tell me what time it is now?",
        "Payne: It's 11:25...",
        "Payne: Ack!",
        "Phoenix: As you can see, this clock is exactly three hours slow!",
        "Phoenix: Precisely the discrepancy between what Mr. Sahwit heard and the actual time of death!",
        "Phoenix: So, Mr. Sahwit...",
        "Phoenix: Try to talk your way out of this one!",
        "Sahwit: ...Hah! Hah hah!",
        "Sahwit: You forgot one thing!",
        "Phoenix: (Uh oh... What's he talking about now...?)",
        "Sahwit: While it may seem like that clock IS running three hours slow...",
        "Sahwit: It proves nothing!",
        "Sahwit: How do you know it was running three hours slow on the day of the murder!?",
        "Sahwit: If you can't prove that, you don't have a case!",
        "Phoenix: ...!",
        "Phoenix: (He's right! How am I going to prove that!?)",
        "Judge: Mr. Wright?",
        "Judge: It seems you lack the critical evidence to support your claim.",
        "Judge: This means I cannot let you indict the witness.",
        "Judge: Unfortunately...",
        "Judge: This ends the cross-examination of Mr. Frank Sahwit.",
        "Sahwit: I come all the way down here to testify, and look what happens!",
        "Sahwit: You treat me like a criminal! A criminal!",
        "Sahwit: You lawyers are all slime!",
        "Phoenix: (Grr! I almost had him!)",
        "Phoenix: (Sorry, Larry... I fa",
        "Phoenix: (There's nothing I can do about it now...)",
        "Mia: Not so fast, Mr. Sahwit!",
        "Phoenix: Mia! I mean, Chief!",
        "Mia: Listen up, Wright!",
        "Mia: Don't throw this one away, not like this! Think!",
        "Phoenix: But, Chief, it's over.",
        "Phoenix: I can't prove the clock was slow the day of the murder!",
        "Phoenix: Nobody can prove that!",
        "Mia: Um... well, yes.",
        "Mia: But that doesn't mean you can't still win! Try thinking out of the box!",
        "Mia: Don't waste time doubting the facts. Assume the clock was three hours slow and...",
        "Mia: Think through it!",
        "Mia: Ask yourself, \"Why was the clock three hours slow?\"",
        "Mia: Figure out the reason, and you'll have your proof!",
        "Mia: Right, Wright?",
        "Mia: Can you think of a reason as to why the clock would be three hours slow?",
        "Phoenix: ...",
        "Phoenix: Wait!",
        "Phoenix: Maybe I can prove it!",
        "Mia: You must have evidence somewhere that can prove it, Wright!",
        "Mia: Find it and let them have it!",
        "Judge: You say the clock was already running slow on the day of the murder...",
        "Judge: Have you found evidence to support this claim?",
        "Phoenix: Of course.",
        "Phoenix: There is a piece of evidence in the Court Record that can prove my claim beyond a doubt!",
        "Sahwit: Hah! Tough words! Let's see you pull this one off!",
        "Judge: Let's see this evidence that proves why the clock was running slow!",
        "Phoenix: The victim had just returned home from abroad the day bef",
        "Phoenix: As we all know, the time difference between here and Paris is nine hours!",
        "Phoenix: When it's 4:00 PM here, it's 1:00 AM the next day there.",
        "Phoenix: The clock wasn't three hours slow, it was nine hours fast!",
        "Phoenix: The victim hadn't reset her clock since returning home!",
        "Phoenix: That's why the time you heard when you struck her dead in her apartment was wrong!",
        "Phoenix: Proof enough for you, Mr. Sahwit? Or should I say... Mr. Di",
        "Judge: Well...",
        "Judge: This case has certainly turned out differently than we all expected.",
        "Judge: Mr. Payne... Your witness?",
        "Payne: He... er... He was arrested and has been taken away, Your Honor.",
        "Judge: Very well.",
        "Judge: I have to say, I'm impressed.",
        "Judge: I don't think I've ever seen someone complete a defense so quickly...",
        "Judge: ...and find the true culprit at the same time!",
        "Phoenix: Thank you, Your Honor.",
        "Judge: At this point, this is only a formality, but...",
        "Judge: This court finds the defendant, Mr. Larry Butz...",
