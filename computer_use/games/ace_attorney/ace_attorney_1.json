            "Mia: Whew, I'm glad I made it on time. Well, I have to say Phoenix, I'm impressed! Not everyone takes on a murder trial right off the bat like this. It says a lot about you... and your client as well.",
            "Phoenix: Um... thanks. Actually, it's because I owe him a favor.",
            "Mia: A favor? You mean, you knew the defendant before this case?",
            "Phoenix: Yes. Actually, I kind of owe my current job to him. He's one of the reasons I became an attorney.",

            "Phoenix: (Hmm... The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)",
            "Phoenix: My name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!",

            "Phoenix: Thank... thank you, Your Honor.",
            "Judge: ... Mr. Wright, given the circumstances... I think we should have a test to ascertain your readiness.",
            "Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. (Gulp... Hands shaking... Eyesight... fading...)",
            "Judge: The test will consist of a few simple questions. Answer them clearly and concisely. Please state the name of the defendant in this case.",
            "Phoenix: The defendant? Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor.",
            "Judge: Correct. Just keep your wits about you and you'll do fine. Next question: This is a murder trial. Tell me, what's the victim's name?",
            "Phoenix: (Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It's... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I'm drawing a total blank here!)",
            "Mia: Phoenix! Are you absolutely SURE you're up to this? You don't even know the victim's name!?",
            "Phoenix: Oh, the victim! O-Of course I know the victim's name! I, um, just forgot. ...Temporarily.",
            "Mia: I think I feel a migraine coming on. Look, the victim's name is listed in the Court Record. Just press [the R Button / Tab] to check it at any time, okay? Remember to check it often. Do it for me, please. I'm begging you.",
            "Judge: Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?",
            "Phoenix: Um... the victim's name is Cindy Stone.",
            "Judge: Correct. Now, tell me, what was the cause of death? She died because she was...?",
            "Phoenix: She was struck once, by a blunt object.",
            "Judge: Correct. You've answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn't proceed. You seem much more relaxed, Mr. Wright. Good for you.",
            "Phoenix: Thank you, Your Honor. (Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)",
            "Judge: Well, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?",
            "Payne: Yes, Your Honor?",
            "Judge: As Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that \"object\" was?",
            "Payne: The murder weapon was this statue of \"The Thinker.\" It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.",
            "Judge: I see... The court accepts it into evidence.",
            "Narration: Statue added to the Court Record.",
            "Mia: Wright... Be sure to pay attention to any evidence added during the trial. That evidence is the only ammunition you have in court. Use [the R Button / Tab] to check the Court Record frequently.",
            "Judge: Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its first witness.",
            "Payne: The prosecution calls the defendant, Mr. Butz, to the stand.",
            "Phoenix: Um, Chief, what do I do now?",
            "Mia: Pay attention. You don't want to miss any information that might help your client's case. You'll get your chance to respond to the prosecution later, so be ready! Let's just hope he doesn't say anything... unfortunate.",
            "Phoenix: (Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... This could be bad.)",
            "Payne: Ahem. Mr. Butz. Is it not true that the victim had recently dumped you?",
            "Butz: Hey, watch it buddy! We were great together! We were Romeo and Juliet, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!",
            "Phoenix: (Um... didn't they all die?)",
            "Butz: I wasn't dumped! She just wasn't taking my phone calls. Or seeing me... Ever. WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?",
            "Payne: Mr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by \"dumped.\" In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!",
            "Butz: Whaddya mean, \"one of them\"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!",
            "Payne: Your Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.",
            "Narration: Passport added to the Court Record.",
            "Judge: Hmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.",
            "Butz: Dude... no way...",
            "Payne: The victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several \"Sugar Daddies.\"",
            "Butz: Daddies? Sugar?",
            "Payne: Yes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.",
            "Butz: Duuude!",
            "Payne: We can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?",
            "Mia: Wright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.",
            "Phoenix: (Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)",
            "Butz: I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!",
            "Judge: Let's continue with the trial, shall we?",
            "Payne: I believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.",
            "Judge: Yes, quite.",
            "Phoenix: (Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)",
            "Payne: Next question! You went to the victim's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?",
            "Butz: Gulp!",
            "Payne: Well, did you, or did you not?",
            "Butz: Heh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't!",
            "Phoenix: (Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)",
            "Judge: Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?",
            "Payne: The man who found the victim's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!",
            "Judge: Order! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.",
            "Payne: Yes, Your Honor.",
            "Phoenix: (This is bad...)",
            "Payne: On the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim's building. Please bring Mr. Frank Sahwit to the stand!",
            "Payne: Mr. Sahwit, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?",
            "Sahwit: Oh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!",
            "Judge: Mr. Sahwit, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell the court what you saw on the day of the murder.",
            "Sahwit: I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.",
            "Sahwit: I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.",
            "Sahwit: Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.",

            "Sahwit: However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.",
            "Sahwit: I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.",
            "Sahwit: I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.",

            "Phoenix: (Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)",
            "Judge: Incidentally, why wasn't the phone in the victim's apartment working?",
            "Payne: Your Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.",
            "Judge: Aren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?",
            "Payne: Yes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.",

            "Phoenix: Uh... what exactly am I supposed to do?",
            "Mia: Why, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!",
            "Phoenix: Lies! What?! He was lying!?",
            "Mia: Your client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?",
            "Phoenix: !!! How do I prove he's not?",
            "Mia: You hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between the Court Record and the witness's testimony. Then, once you've found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in the witness's face!",
            "Phoenix: Um... okay.",

            "Edgeworth: You truly are a work of art, Mr. Phoenix Wright.",
            "Phoenix: W-what's that supposed to mean!?",
            "Edgeworth: It was you who just proved that \"The Thinker\" was empty!",
            "Phoenix: Oh... (Urk! Of course it wouldn't ring!)",
            "Edgeworth: What's more, the witness has a rock-solid alibi.",

            "Edgeworth: Perhaps you could explain to the poor, misguided Mr. Wright?",
            "Edgeworth: That you were in the hotel at the time of the murder.",

            "April: Tee hee? Didn't the murder take place at 9:00 at night?",
            "April: Gee, that's the exact time I ordered some room service from the hotel bellboy!",
            "Edgeworth: Incidentally, the bellboy corroborates the witness's story.",

            "Phoenix: Absolutely!",
            "Edgeworth: Even if that was the case, which it's not, you still have to prove one thing!",
            "Edgeworth: Did the victim ever say that the weapon was a clock on the phone?",
            "Edgeworth: Can you prove that? I THINK NOT!",
            "Phoenix: Oh yeah? I THINK I CAN! It's simple!",
            "Edgeworth: WHAAAAT!?",
            "Phoenix: Here's my proof.",
            "Phoenix: The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is...",

            "April: That... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? \"The Thinker,\" I think?",
            "April: Well? Does the accuracy of my report not startle you? Tee hee!",
            "Judge: I... see.",
            "Judge: I only wish you had been so detailed from the beginning.",
            "Judge: Please begin the cross-examination.",
            "April: I did see everything! I did!",
            "April: The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right.",
            "April: Then the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her...",
            "April: And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!",
            "Phoenix: I present the The Thinker.",
            "Phoenix: Miss May.",
            "April: Revealing? Oooh, you'd like that, wouldn't you. Naughty Mr. Lawyer...",
            "Phoenix: But there's no way of knowing that just by looking at it!",
            "April: Urp!",
            "Phoenix: Another person in much the same position as you recently called this a \"clock,\" too...",
            "Phoenix: Miss May. Can you explain how you know this was a clock?",
            "April: Oooh... urp!",
            "Edgeworth: The witness saw the murder with her own eyes! That's all that's importan",
            "Edgeworth: The defense is trying to confuse the issue with trivial concerns!",
            "Judge: Yes... yes, of course. You will withdraw your question, Mr. Wright.",
            "Phoenix: But questions are all I have, Your Honor!",
            "Phoenix: And as you may recall, I've caught murderers with these questions before!",
            "Phoenix: (Well, only once...)",
            "Judge: ...",
            "Judge: Objection sustained. You may continue to question the witness.",
            "Phoenix: (Whew, that was close.)",
            "Phoenix: (If he stopped me there, the trial would be over!)",
            "April: Huh? What? So... what happens now?",
            "Phoenix: What happens now is you answer my question! How did you know it was a clock?",
            "April: What...! Th-that's...",
            "April: ...Because... I heard it?",
            "April: Yes! I heard it say the time!",
            "Phoenix: So, you've been to the law offices of Fey & Co.!",
            "April: N-n-no! Hey, I didn't say that! Why would I go there!",
            "Edgeworth: She could easily have heard the clock!",
            "Phoenix: (I can't give up now!)",
            "Phoenix: I'm not satisfied because...",
            "Phoenix: Your Honor, members of the court...",
            "Phoenix: It is inconceivable that the clock in question rang!",
            "Phoenix: That clock is missing its clockwork!",
            "Judge: H-how co",
            "Phoenix: Just take a look... Right now!",
            "Judge: Oh!",
            "Phoenix: See anything interesting, Your Honor?",
            "Judge: It is as the defense says!",
            "Judge: This clock is missing its clockwork!",
            "Judge: It's quite empty!",
            "Judge: Mr. Wright!",
            "Judge: Would you care to explain to the court the meaning of this?",
            "Phoenix: It is as you can see.",
            "Phoenix: Therefore, this witness...",
            "Phoenix: is a big, fat liar!",
            "Phoenix: Well, Miss May?",
            "Edgeworth: Tsk tsk.",
            "Phoenix: ?",
            "Edgeworth: Quite a show you've put on for us, Mr. Wright.",
            "Phoenix: (He knew the clock was empty! Somehow... he knew!)",
            "Edgeworth: I'm afraid you've forgotten one thing, however.",
            "Edgeworth: Indeed, the clock is empty. As you say... it can't ring.",
            "Edgeworth: However, we must ask: when was the clockwork removed?",
            "Judge: !",
            "Judge: Hmm! That's true. That is a possibility.",
            "Judge: The clock might have been emptied after she heard it.",
            "Edgeworth: And that is exactly what happened, Your Honor!",
            "Judge: Well, Mr. Wright?",
            "Judge: Can you prove when the clockwork was removed?",
            "Edgeworth: Ho hoh! Impossible, of course...",
            "Phoenix: I have proof.",
            "Edgeworth: W-what!?",
            "Phoenix: Wasn't it you who told me \"proof is everything\"?",
            "Phoenix: Well, I was listening.",
            "Phoenix: And now I'll show you the \"proof\" you like so much!",
            "Phoenix: The evidence that proves when the clockwork was removed is...",
            "Phoenix: I present the Maya's Cell Phone.",
            "Phoenix: Take a look at this!",
            "April: Ooh hoo! You have a girlie phone!",
            "Phoenix: W-wait! Wait! This isn't my phone!",
            "Phoenix: Listen!",
            "Phoenix: This is the defendant's cell phone, and it contains a recording...",
            "Phoenix: A recording of a conversation she had with the victim on the day of the murder!",
            "Edgeworth: The defendant's cell phone!? Th-this wasn't brought to my attention!",
            "Phoenix: Perhaps Detective Gumshoe overlooked it?",
            "Edgeworth: *grumble* (The good detective better remember he's up for evaluation soon...)",
            "Phoenix: (I gotta say, I'm starting to feel bad for the big fella.)",
            "Phoenix: Let's hear the conversation.",
            "Cellular: *beep*",
            "Phoenix: Your Honor,",
            "Phoenix: I think this makes it clear the clockwork was already gone by the time this was recorded,",
            "Phoenix: which was well before the witness even arrived at her hotel!",
            "April: Muh... muh... muh!?",
            "Phoenix: Just how did you know that weapon was a clock!?",
            "April: ...",
            "April: W-well...!",
            "April: I saw that clock before!",
            "April: Um... what store was that again? I-I go to so many!",
            "April: Oops! I forgot!\\n*wink*",
            "Judge: So the witness had seen it before. That would make sense.",
            "Judge: Does the defense have any objections, Mr. Wright?",
            "Phoenix: But this directly contradicts a piece of evidence already submitted to this court!",
            "Judge: Well then, let's see it.",
            "Judge: Please produce this evidence that will prove the witness had not seen the clock before.",
            "Phoenix: It's simple.",
            "Phoenix: This clock was never in any store, ever!",
            "April: W-whaaat!?",
            "Phoenix: A friend of mine made that clock.",
            "Phoenix: Only two exist in the world.",
            "Phoenix: And the one that isn't here is in police custody!",
            "April: I-impossible! Everything is sold in stores!",
            "April: Mmpf...",
            "Phoenix: Oh? Excuses not on sale today?",
            "April: Ooooorrrrr",
            "April: That stupid clock doesn't matter, okay!?",
            "April: She did it! And she should die for it! Die!",
            "Judge: W-w-w",
            "Judge: T-this is a court of law, and the witness will remain calm!",
            "April: Oh! Oh? Oh hoh ho! S-silly me! *grunt*",
            "April: Did I, um, like... lose it?",
            "Phoenix: (S-scary...)",
            "Judge: Miss May, let me ask.",
            "Judge: Tell me, how did you know the weapon was a clock?",
            "Judge: Hmm... oh dear.",
            "Judge: Does the defense have an opinion on this... behavior?",
            "Phoenix: (Okay, this is it!)",
            "Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. Allow me to explain how I see the truth of the matter.",
            "Phoenix: Miss April May, you knew the weapon was a clock because...",
            "Phoenix: (This is familiar territory. I'll just use the same approach as with Larry.)",
            "Phoenix: Miss May held that very clock in her hands!",
            "Judge: Mr. Wright! When was this!?",
            "Phoenix: When she used it to strike the victim! When else?",
            "Judge: Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?",
            "Phoenix: April May, you killed Mia Fey, I say!",
            "Phoenix: And when you struck, the force of the impact made \"The Thinker\" ring!",
            "Phoenix: That's when you heard it!",
            "Edgeworth: ...",
            "Edgeworth: You truly are a work of art, Mr. Phoenix Wright.",
            "Phoenix: W-what's that supposed to mean!?",
            "Edgeworth: It was you who just proved that \"The Thinker\" was empty!",
            "Phoenix: Oh... (Urk! Of course it wouldn't ring!)",
            "Edgeworth: What's more, the witness has a rock-solid alibi.",
            "Edgeworth: Miss May?",
            "Edgeworth: Perhaps you could explain to the poor, misguided Mr. Wright?",
            "Edgeworth: That you were in the hotel at the time of the murder.",
            "Phoenix: (S-she can't prove it! She did it!)",
            "April: It would be MY pleasure!",
            "April: Yes way, Mr. Lawyer.",
            "April: Tee hee? Didn't the murder take place at 9:00 at night?",
            "April: Gee, that's the exact time I ordered some room service from the hotel bellboy!",
            "Edgeworth: Incidentally, the bellboy corroborates the witness's story.",
            "Edgeworth: Ergo, she was not at the crime scene! Rock solid!",
            "Judge: Mr. Wright! You've just ma",
            "Phoenix: S-sorry, Your Honor. (That... didn't go so well.)",
            "Phoenix: (But, if that's the case...)",
            "Phoenix: (Then how did she know \"The Thinker\" was a clock!?)",
            "Phoenix: (...)",
            "Phoenix: (Wait!)",
            "Phoenix: Your Honor, I figured it out!",
            "Phoenix: There is one other way Miss April May could have known it was a clock!",
            "Phoenix: One way alone! And I have proof!",
            "Judge: Well... proof, you say?",
            "Judge: Then, the court will examine your proof, Mr. Wright.",
            "Judge: How did the witness know \"The Thinker\" was a clock?",
            "Phoenix: I present the Wiretap.",
            "Phoenix: Have a look at this.",
            "April: Ah! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh...",
            "Phoenix: I found this in Miss May's room.",
            "Phoenix: Miss April May?",
            "Phoenix: You were tapping the victim, Ms. Mia Fey's phone, were you not?",
            "Judge: I'm not entirely sure that it is. Objection overruled.",
            "Judge: It troubles me that our witness was in possession of a wiretap.",
            "Edgeworth: This is outrageous! Does the defense truly claim that the witness was tapping her phone?",
            "Phoenix: Absolutely!",
            "Edgeworth: Even if that was the case, which it's not, you still have to prove one thing!",
            "Edgeworth: Did the victim ever say that the weapon was a clock on the phone?",
            "Edgeworth: Can you prove that? I THINK NOT!",
            "Phoenix: Oh yeah? I THINK I CAN! It's simple!",
            "Edgeworth: WHAAAAT!?",
            "Phoenix: Here's my proof.",
            "Phoenix: The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is...",
            "Phoenix: I present the defendant's cell phone.",
            "Judge: Yes, we've seen that.",
            "Maya: [Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.]",
            "Mia: [Well, actually there's something I want you to hold on to for me.]",
            "Maya: [Again? What's it this time?]",
            "Mia: [It's... a clock.]",
            "Mia: [It's made to look like that statue, \"The Thinker.\" And it tells you the time!]",
            "Phoenix: Miss April May!",
            "Phoenix: You used a wiretap to listen to this conversation!",
            "Phoenix: That's how you knew \"The Thinker\" was a clock!",
            "Phoenix: Am I wrong!?",
            "April: I... I...",
            "Edgeworth: Your Honor, this is ridiculous!",
            "Phoenix: Your Honor, look at the witness's face! Does she seem amused to you!?",
            "Phoenix: The defense demands an answer.",
            "April: La... laaa... lrrrrgf!",
            "Judge: Witness, answer the question. Did you tap her phone?",
            "Judge: Miss May!",
            "April: You... you LAWYER!",
            "April: Oh, so I'm the bad girl, is that it? Is that it!?",
            "Phoenix: (empty dialog - appears to be waiting for player input)",
            "Phoenix: (Now to deal the final blow!)",
            "Phoenix: Miss May, confess. You did it, didn't you?",
            "April: Are you out of your mind!? Oh wait, I forgot... you're a lawyer! You must be!",
            "April: At the time of the murder...",
            "April: I was in my hotel room, getting room service!",
            "April: How could I have killed her?",
            "April: If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy!",
            "Judge: Well, does the defense have anything to say?",
            "Phoenix: Um, well... (Come on, think of something!)",
            "Phoenix: There's something suspicious here, and I'm going to get to the bottom of it!",
            "April: I think you've sunken quite low enough already.",
            "Edgeworth: I object to calling the bellboy!",
            "Phoenix: W-why? What's your reason?",
            "Edgeworth: Because I hold that the wiretapping had nothing to do with the killing!",
            "Phoenix: ...!",
            "Edgeworth: However...",
            "Edgeworth: If you agree to one condition, I'll consent to calling this witness.",
            "Phoenix: Condition...?",
            "EDGEWORTH: If Miss April May's alibi is not called into question after you examine the bellboy...",
            "Edgeworth: then you will recognize that Miss April May was not the killer, thus she is innocent!",
            "Edgeworth: And thereby, you must also accept the verdict of \"guilty\" for Ms. Maya Fey!",
            "Edgeworth: That is my condition.",
            "Phoenix: (What...!?)",
            "Phoenix: (I'd better find something suspicious in that bellboy's testimony...)",
            "Phoenix: (Otherwise Maya will be declared \"guilty\" on the spot!)",
            "Phoenix: (What should I do...?)",
            "Phoenix: (Alright! I've got nothing to lose! Except for... well, everything!)",
            "Phoenix: Understood. I accept your condition.",
            "Edgeworth: Hmph.",
            "Edgeworth: Fool... You fell right into my trap!",
            "Phoenix: (Uh oh!)",
            "Judge: Very well!",
            "Judge: The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!",
            "Edgeworth: I believ",
            "Edgeworth: He certainly does look like a bellboy.",
            "Bellboy: Yes, sir.",
            "Bellboy: I received your summons in the middle of work, sir. I'm happy to be of service.",
            "Judge: That tea set looks rather heavy, so without further ado,",
            "Judge: the witness may begin his testimony.",

            "Bellboy: I am the head bellboy at the fine Gatewater Hotel, in business for four generations!",
            "Bellboy: I believe I received a call after 8:00 in the evening from our guest, Miss May.",
            "Bellboy: She asked for an ice coffee to be brought to her at 9:00, on the dot, sir.",
            "Bellboy: I brought it to her at precisely the requested time, of course.",
            "Bellboy: And I delivered the ice coffee to our guest Miss May, herself.",

            "Phoenix: \"Ab-SO-lutely\"...?",
            "Bellboy: Yes, sir. As in, \"so very absolutely,\" sir. It's an endearing mannerism of mine.",

            "Bellboy: Well, when I brought the room service, sir...",
            "Bellboy: S-she... the guest, sir, favored me w-with a, um, an \"embrasser,\" sir.",
            "Phoenix: \"Embrasser\"!? Is that French for \"embrace\"?",
            "Bellboy: It's French for \"kiss,\" sir. But not a French kiss, sir! More of a peck on the c",
            "Phoenix: Wh-why would she have done that...?",
            "Bellboy: I believe, perhaps, she was momentarily swayed by my prim demeanor, sir.",
            "Bellboy: It was a moment I shall never, ever forget, sir.",
            "Phoenix: (Sounds pretty fishy to me...)",
            "Phoenix: (I think our Miss May was up to something and wanted the bellboy to remember her!)",

            "Phoenix: (But I have to find something to use in his testimony!)",

            "Edgeworth: \"Innocent\"...? How can we know that? The guilty will always lie, to avoid being found out. There's no way to tell who is guilty and who is innocent! All that I can hope to do is get every defendant declared \"guilty\"! So I make that my policy.",

            "White: Needless to say that man was none other than you, Mr. Lawyer!",
            "White: I called Miss May over at once. She, too, was surprised of course.",
            "White: The victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!",
            "Phoenix: Can you be a little more detailed about that?",
            "Phoenix: I think it's worth knowing exactly what happened.",
            "White: Of course! Comprende! I understand!",
            "White: The victim was attacked, by you, and ran to the left.",
            "White: You gave chase, and struck her down!",

            "Phoenix: But that directly contradicts Miss May's testimony!",
            "Phoenix: She clearly stated that the victim ran \"right\"!",
            "White: ...!",
            "White: Oh hoh hoh. It is simple. You have misheard her.",

            "White: That lady ran to the left! I am sure of it!",
            "Phoenix: Then there can be only one explanation.",

            "Phoenix: Obviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!",

            "Phoenix: This is where he was! Look! When the victim ran for the door... If he was watching from this point, to him it would appear that she ran to the 'left.'",
            "Edgeworth: Please! This is no time for jokes in ill taste! That is where the killer was standing!",
            "Judge: Order! I will have order! Anyone disturbing the order of this courtroom will be held in contempt! Mr. Wright! What are you suggesting!?",
            "White: R-r-rapscallion!!!",
            "Edgeworth: The postulations of the defense are a distortion of the truth, Your Honor!",

            "Phoenix: (What now!? He's... laughing!?)",
            "White: The hilarity of the moment made me remember something... It appears I have been unclear, and for this, I apologize. Mr. Your Honor... Might I be allowed to testify once more?",
            "Judge: Very well, let's hear your revised testimony.",
            "Phoenix: (Good luck. You can't fix a broken testimony, buddy!)",
            "White: Miss May's testimony was correct... as was mine!",

In the bottom-left, a plant has been knocked over near a fallen object, with debris scattered into the light. Two pieces of furniture (likely chairs) are overturned in the middle of the room. From the window’s perspective, only the right half of the room is clearly visible—especially the plant debris and doorway area.
