In the 23 years of our acquaintance, this has generally proven true. He has a tendency for finding himself in problematic situations. One thing I can say though: it's rarely his fault. He simply has awful luck. But I understand better than most that deep down, he's a decent person. That and I'm indebted to him. Which explains why I accepted the case... to establish his innocence.

            "Phoenix: (Uh oh, Larry becomes excited easily... This could be problematic.)",
            "Payne: Ahem. Mr. Butz. Isn't it factual that the victim had recently terminated your relationship?",
            "Butz: Hey, be careful friend! We had an excellent relationship! We were comparable to Romeo and Juliet, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!",
            "Phoenix: (Um... didn't all those individuals perish?)",
            "Butz: I wasn't dumped! She simply wasn't accepting my calls. Or meeting me... at all. WHY DOES IT CONCERN YOU, ANYWAY!?",
            "Payne: Mr. Butz, what you're describing is typically what we refer to as 'dumped.' In reality, she had completely abandoned you... and was socializing with other men! She had just returned from abroad with one of them the day preceding the murder!",
            "Butz: What do you mean, 'one of them'!? Falsehoods! All completely false! I reject every word!",

            "Phoenix: (Yeah... Larry tends to speak impulsively in all the wrong ways. Should I...?)",
            "Butz: I'm going to expire. I'm simply going to collapse dead! Yeah, and when I encounter her in the afterlife... I'll uncover the truth about this!",

            "Judge: Aren't telephones supposed to function during power outages?",

            "Phoenix: !!! How can I demonstrate he's not?",
            "Mia: You possess the solution! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony with the available evidence. There must be a discrepancy somewhere! First, identify contradictions between the Court Record and the witness's testimony. Then, once you've located the contradicting evidence... present it and confront the witness with it!",

In the 23 years of our acquaintance, this has generally proven true. He has a tendency for finding himself in problematic situations. One thing I can say though: it's rarely his fault. He simply has awful luck. But I understand better than most that deep down, he's a decent person. That and I'm indebted to him. Which explains why I accepted the case... to establish his innocence.

In the 23 years of our acquaintance, this has generally proven true. He has a tendency for finding himself in problematic situations. One thing I can say though: it's rarely his fault. He simply has awful luck. But I understand better than most that deep down, he's a decent person. That and I'm indebted to him. Which explains why I accepted the case... to establish his innocence.

            "Mia: You possess the solution! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony with the available evidence. There must be a discrepancy somewhere! First, identify contradictions between the Court Record and the witness's testimony. Then, once you've located the contradicting evidence... present it and confront the witness with it!",

In the 23 years of our acquaintance, this has generally proven true. He has a tendency for finding himself in problematic situations. One thing I can say though: it's rarely his fault. He simply has awful luck. But I understand better than most that deep down, he's a decent person. That and I'm indebted to him. Which explains why I accepted the case... to establish his innocence.

            "Phoenix: The, um, defense is prepared, Your Honor.",
            "Judge: Ahem. Mr. Wright? This is your inaugural trial, correct?",
            "Phoenix: Y-Yes, Your Honor. I'm, um, somewhat nervous.",
            "Judge: Your behavior during this proceeding will determine your client's destiny. Murder constitutes a severe accusation. For your client's benefit, I hope you can manage your anxiety.",
            "Phoenix: Thank... thank you, Your Honor.",
            "Judge: ... Mr. Wright, considering the situation... I believe we should conduct an assessment to verify your preparedness.",
            "Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. (Gulp... Hands trembling... Vision... deteriorating...)",
            "Judge: The assessment will include several basic inquiries. Answer them clearly and succinctly. Please identify the defendant in this case.",
            "Phoenix: The defendant? That would be Larry Butz, Your Honor.",
            "Judge: Accurate. Simply maintain your composure and you'll perform adequately. Next question: This constitutes a murder trial. Tell me, what is the victim's identity?",
            "Phoenix: (Phew, I know this one! Fortunate that I reviewed the case file thoroughly multiple times. It's... wait... Oh no! No... impossible! I've forgotten! I'm experiencing complete mental emptiness!)",
            "Mia: Phoenix! Are you absolutely CONFIDENT about this? You can't even recall the victim's name!?",
            "Phoenix: Oh, the victim! O-Of course I know the victim's identity! I, um, just temporarily forgot.",
            "Mia: I believe I'm developing a headache. Look, the victim's identity is documented in the Court Record. Simply press [the R Button / Tab] to review it anytime, understood? Remember to check frequently. Do this for me, please. I'm imploring you.",
            "Judge: Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this matter?",
            "Phoenix: Um... the victim is known as Cindy Stone.",
            "Judge: Accurate. Now, inform me, what caused her death? She died because she was...?",
            "Phoenix: She received a single blow from a blunt instrument.",
            "Judge: Accurate. You've addressed all my questions. I see no reason to delay proceedings. You appear much calmer, Mr. Wright. That's positive.",
            "Phoenix: Thank you, Your Honor. (Though I certainly don't FEEL calm.)",
            "Judge: Well, then... Initially, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?",
            "Payne: Yes, Your Honor?",
            "Judge: As Mr. Wright just informed us, the victim was struck with a blunt instrument. Would you clarify for the court exactly what that 'instrument' was?",
            "Payne: The murder weapon was this sculpture of 'The Thinker.' It was discovered resting on the floor, adjacent to the victim.",
            "Judge: I see... The court admits it as evidence.",
            "Narration: Statue incorporated into the Court Record.",
            "Mia: Wright... Ensure you monitor any evidence introduced during the trial. That evidence constitutes your only resource in court. Utilize [the R Button / Tab] to examine the Court Record regularly.",
            "Judge: Mr. Payne, the prosecution may summon its initial witness.",
            "Payne: The prosecution calls the defendant, Mr. Butz, to testify.",
            "Phoenix: Um, Chief, what should I do now?",
            "Mia: Remain attentive. You don't want to miss any details that might benefit your client's defense. You'll receive your opportunity to counter the prosecution later, so be prepared! Let's just hope he avoids saying anything... problematic.",
            "Phoenix: (Uh oh, Larry becomes excited easily... This could be problematic.)",
            "Payne: Ahem. Mr. Butz. Isn't it factual that the victim had recently terminated your relationship?",
            "Butz: Hey, be careful friend! We had an excellent relationship! We were comparable to Romeo and Juliet, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!",
            "Phoenix: (Um... didn't all those individuals perish?)",
            "Butz: I wasn't dumped! She simply wasn't accepting my calls. Or meeting me... at all. WHY DOES IT CONCERN YOU, ANYWAY!?",
            "Payne: Mr. Butz, what you're describing is typically what we refer to as 'dumped.' In reality, she had completely abandoned you... and was socializing with other men! She had just returned from abroad with one of them the day preceding the murder!",
            "Butz: What do you mean, 'one of them'!? Falsehoods! All completely false! I reject every word!",
            "Payne: Your Honor, the victim's passport. According to this document, she was in Paris until the day before her demise.",
            "Narration: Passport incorporated into the Court Record.",
            "Judge: Hmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day preceding the murder.",
            "Butz: Man... impossible...",
            "Payne: The victim worked as a model, but didn't earn substantial income. It seems she had several 'Sugar Daddies.'",
            "Butz: Daddies? Sugar?",
            "Payne: Yes. Older gentlemen who provided her money and presents. She accepted their financial support to maintain her lifestyle.",
            "Butz: Maaaan!",
            "Payne: We can clearly understand what kind of individual this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, how do you perceive her now?",
            "Mia: Wright... I don't believe you want him answering that question.",
            "Phoenix: (Yeah... Larry tends to speak impulsively in all the wrong ways. Should I...?)",
            "Butz: I'm going to expire. I'm simply going to collapse dead! Yeah, and when I encounter her in the afterlife... I'll uncover the truth about this!",
            "Judge: Let's resume the trial, shall we?",
            "Payne: I believe the accused's motivation is evident to everyone.",
            "Judge: Yes, undoubtedly.",
            "Phoenix: (Oh no. This situation appears extremely unfavorable.)",
            "Payne: Next question! You visited the victim's residence on the murder date, didn't you?",
            "Butz: Gulp!",
            "Payne: Well, did you, or didn't you?",
            "Butz: Heh? Heh heh. Well, perhaps I did, and perhaps I didn't!",
            "Phoenix: (Uh oh. He went there. What action should I take?)",
            "Judge: Well, that simplifies the situation. Who is your witness?",
            "Payne: The individual who discovered the victim's corpse. Immediately before making the grisly discovery... He observed the defendant escaping the crime scene!",
            "Judge: Order! Order in the courtroom! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may summon its witness.",
            "Payne: Yes, Your Honor.",
            "Phoenix: (This is problematic...)",
            "Payne: On the murder date, my witness was selling newspaper subscriptions at the victim's building. Please bring Mr. Frank Sahwit to the stand!",
            "Payne: Mr. Sahwit, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?",
            "Sahwit: Oh, oh yes! Newspapers, indeed!",
            "Judge: Mr. Sahwit, you may commence your testimony. Please inform the court about your observations on the murder date.",
            "Sahwit: I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.",
            "Sahwit: I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.",
            "Sahwit: Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.",
            "Sahwit: Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!",
            "Sahwit: I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.",
            "Sahwit: I thought to call the police immediately!",
            "Sahwit: However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.",
            "Sahwit: I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.",
            "Sahwit: I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.",
            "Sahwit: The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.",
            "Judge: Hmm...",
            "Phoenix: (Larry! Why didn't you reveal the truth? I can't defend against such testimony!)",
            "Judge: Incidentally, why wasn't the telephone in the victim's residence operational?",
            "Payne: Your Honor, during the murder, there was a power outage in the building.",
            "Judge: Aren't telephones supposed to function during power outages?",
            "Payne: Yes, Your Honor... However, certain cordless telephones don't operate normally. The telephone that Mr. Sahwit attempted to use was one of those. Your Honor... I have documentation of the power outage for your review.",
            "Narration: Blackout Record incorporated into the Court Record.",
            "Judge: Now, Mr. Wright...",
            "Phoenix: Yes! Er... yes, Your Honor?",
            "Judge: You may commence your cross-examination.",
            "Phoenix: C-Cross-examination, Your Honor?",
            "Mia: Alright, Wright, this is the moment. The genuine challenge!",
            "Phoenix: Uh... what exactly should I do?",
            "Mia: Why, you expose the falsehoods in the testimony the witness just provided!",
            "Phoenix: Falsehoods! What?! He was being untruthful!?",
            "Mia: Your client is innocent, correct? Then that witness must have presented false testimony! Or is your client actually... guilty?",
            "Phoenix: !!! How can I demonstrate he's not?",
            "Mia: You possess the solution! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony with the available evidence. There must be a discrepancy somewhere! First, identify contradictions between the Court Record and the witness's testimony. Then, once you've located the contradicting evidence... present it and confront the witness with it!",
            "Phoenix: Um... understood.",
            "Mia: Access the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab], then highlight contradictions in the testimony!",
            "Phoenix: You found the body at 1:00 PM. You're sure?",
            "Sahwit: Yes. It was 1:00 PM, for certain.",
            "Phoenix: Frankly, I find that hard to believe!",
            "Phoenix: Your statement directly contradicts the autopsy report.",
            "Phoenix: The autopsy notes the time of death at sometime after 4PM.",
            "Phoenix: There was nobody to... er... no \"body\" to find at 1:00 PM!",
            "Phoenix: How do you explain this three-hour gap?",
            "Sahwit: !!!",
            "Sahwit: Oh, that! Oh, er...",
            "Payne: This is trivial! The witness merely forgot the time!",
            "Judge: After his testimony, I find that hard to believe.",
            "Judge: Mr. Sahwit...",
            "Judge: Why were you so certain that you found the body at 1:00 PM?",
            "Sahwit: I... er... well, I... Gee, that's a really good question!",
            "Mia: Great job, Wright! Way to put him on the spot!",
            "Mia: That's all you have to do: point out contradictions!",
            "Mia: Lies always beget more lies!",
            "Mia: See through one, and their whole story falls apart!",
            "Sahwit: Wait! I remember now!",
            "Judge: Would you care to give your testimony again?",
            "Sahwit: You see, when I found the body, I heard the time.",
            "Sahwit: There was a voice saying the time... It was probably coming from the television.",
            "Sahwit: Oh, but it was three hours off, wasn't it?",
            "Sahwit: I guess the victim must have been watching a video of a taped program!",
            "Sahwit: That's why I thought it was 1:00 PM!",
            "Sahwit: Terribly sorry about the misunderstanding...",
            "Judge: Hmm... I see.",
            "Judge: Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.",
            "Mia: Wright!",
            "Mia: You know what to do!",
            "Phoenix: I've got this one.",
            "Phoenix: Hold it right there! The prosecution has said there was a blackout at the time of the discovery! And this record proves it!",
            "Sahwit: ...!",
            "Phoenix: You couldn't have heard a television... or a video!",
            "Sahwit: Gah!!!",
            "Sahwit: I... well... urk!",
            "Judge: The defense has a point.",
            "Judge: Do you have an explanation for this, Mr. Sahwit?",
            "Sahwit: No, I... I find it quite puzzling myself! Quite!",
            "Sahwit: ...",
            "Sahwit: W-wait! I remember now!",
            "Judge: Mr. Sahwit?",
            "Judge: The court would prefer to hear an accurate testimony from the very beginning.",
            "Judge: These constant corrections are harming your credibility.",
            "Judge: That, and you seem rather... distraught.",
            "Sahwit: M-my apologies, Your Honor!",
            "Sahwit: It... er, it must have been the shock of finding",
            "Sahwit: the body!",
            "Judge: Very well, Mr. Sahwit.",
            "Judge: Let's hear your testimony once more please.",
            "Sahwit: Actually, I didn't \"hear\" the time... I \"saw\" it!",
            "Sahwit: There was a table clock in the apartment, wasn't there!",
            "Sahwit: Yeah, the murder weapon! The killer used it to hit the victim!",
            "Sahwit: That must have been what I saw.",
            "Judge: You saw a clock? I guess that would explain it.",
            "Judge: The defense may cross-examine the witness.",
            "Phoenix: Gladly.",
            "Phoenix: The murder weapon wasn't a clock. It was this statue!",
            "Phoenix: Now how is this supposed to be a clock?",
            "Sahwit: Y-you with your \"objections,\" and your \"evidence\"... Just who do you think you are",
            "Phoenix: Just answer the question, Mr. Sahwit.",
            "Sahwit: Hey, I... I saw it there, okay! That's a clock!",
            "PAYNE: Your Honor! If I may...",
            "Judge: Yes, Mr. Payne?",
            "Payne: As the witness stated, this statue is indeed a clock.",
            "Payne: The neck is a switch. You just tilt it, and it says the time out loud.",
            "Payne: As it doesn't look like a clock, I submitted it as a statue. My apologies.",
            "Judge: I see.",
            "Judge: So the murder weapon was a table clock after all.",
            "Judge: Well, Mr. Wright?",
            "Judge: It appears that the witness's testimony was correct. This is a clock.",
            "Phoenix: Your Honor, there is a gaping hole in the witness's testimony!",
            "Phoenix: The only way he could have known the weapon was a clock is to hold it in his hand. Yet the witness testified that he never entered the apartment! Clearly, a contradiction!",
            "Judge: Hmm... indeed!",
            "Phoenix: You're lying!",
            "Phoenix: You were inside the apartment on the day of the murder!",
            "Sahwit: Oh yeah? Prove it! Prove I went in there!",
            "Phoenix: I'll do better than that! I can prove you were the one who killed her!",
            "Phoenix: You struck her with the clock, and the shock of the blow triggered the clock's voice!",
            "Phoenix: That was the sound you heard!",
            "Judge: Order in the court!",
            "Judge: Intriguing. Please continue, Mr. Wright.",
            "Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor.",
            "Phoenix: Mr. Sahwit.",
            "Phoenix: The sound must have left quite an impression on you.",
            "Phoenix: Understandable, since the murder weapon spoke just as you hit t",
            "Phoenix: That voice was burned into your mind.",
            "Phoenix: That's why you were so certain about the time!",
            "Payne: W-w-what's the meaning of this?",
            "Payne: This is all baseless conjecture!",
            "Phoenix: Baseless...?",
            "Judge: Would the witness care to elaborate?",
            "Judge: Did you strike the victim with the clock?",
            "Sahwit: I... I...! That... that day... I... I never!",
            "Sahwit: I-it was him, I tell you! I saw him!",
            "Sahwit: H-he killed her and he should burn! Burn! Give him death!",
            "Payne: There isn't a shred of evidence supporting the defense's claims!",
            "Judge: Mr. Wright!",
            "Phoenix: Your Honor?",
            "Judge: You claim the sound the witness heard came from the clock...",
            "Judge: Do you have any evidence?",
            "Phoenix: (The whole case is riding on this! I'd better think it through carefully!)",
            "Phoenix: Y-Your Honor.",
            "Phoenix: The sound Mr. Sahwit heard was definitely this clock.",
            "Phoenix: A fact which is clear if you simply...",
            "Phoenix: I ask the court to listen very carefully...",
            "Phoenix: Well, he is \"The Thinker,\" after all.",
            "Judge: So, we've heard the clock. What are your conclusions, Mr. Wright?",
            "Phoenix: Mr. Payne... can you tell me what time it is now?",
            "Payne: It's 11:25...",
            "Payne: Ack!",
            "Phoenix: As you can see, this clock is exactly three hours slow!",
            "Phoenix: Precisely the discrepancy between what Mr. Sahwit heard and the actual time of death!",
            "Phoenix: So, Mr. Sahwit...",
            "Phoenix: Try to talk your way out of this one!",
            "Sahwit: ...Hah! Hah hah!",
            "Sahwit: You forgot one thing!",
            "Phoenix: (Uh oh... What's he talking about now...?)",
            "Sahwit: While it may seem like that clock IS running three hours slow...",
            "Sahwit: How do you know it was running three hours slow on the day of the murder!?",
            "Sahwit: If you can't prove that, you don't have a case!",
            "Phoenix: (He's right! How am I going to prove that!?)",
            "Judge: Mr. Wright?",
            "Judge: It seems you lack the critical evidence to support your claim.",
            "Judge: This means I cannot let you indict the witness.",
            "Judge: Unfortunately...",
            "Judge: This ends the cross-examination of Mr. Frank Sahwit.",
            "Sahwit: I come all the way down here to testify, and look what happens!",

            "Phoenix: (Grr! I almost had him!)",

            "Mia: Not so fast, Mr. Sahwit!",
            "Phoenix: Mia! I mean, Chief!",
            "Mia: Listen up, Wright!",
            "Mia: Don't throw this one away, not like this! Think!",
            "Phoenix: But, Chief, it's over.",
            "Phoenix: I can't prove the clock was slow the day of the murder!",
            "Phoenix: Nobody can prove that!",
            "Mia: Um... well, yes.",
            "Mia: But that doesn't mean you can't still win! Try thinking out of the box!",
            "Mia: Don't waste time doubting the facts. Assume the clock was three hours slow and...",

            "Mia: Ask yourself, \"Why was the clock three hours slow?\"",
            "Mia: Figure out the reason, and you'll have your proof!",
            "Mia: Right, Wright?",
            "Mia: Can you think of a reason as to why the clock would be three hours slow?",
            "Phoenix: Wait!",
            "Phoenix: Maybe I can prove it!",
            "Mia: You must have evidence somewhere that can prove it, Wright!",

What's this? \"When my sister couldn't find any contradictions in a witness's testimony she would bluff it and press the witness on every detail! The witness always slips up and says something incorrect... It worked numerous times!\" Heh... I should have expected Maya would know some of her sister's techniques! Alright. Let's attempt this!)",

What's this? \"When my sister couldn't find any contradictions in a witness's testimony she would bluff it and press the witness on every detail!

            "Judge: Witness, answer the question. Did you wiretap the phone?",

            "Phoenix: W-why? What's your reason?",
            "Edgeworth: Because I argue that the wiretapping has nothing to do with the murder!",

            "Edgeworth: If Miss April May's alibi is not disproven through the bellboy's testimony...",
            "Edgeworth: then you must acknowledge Miss May's innocence.",

            "Bellboy: Yes, sir. Indeed I do, sir.",
            "Bellboy: I received your summons right in the middle of my duties, sir. But I am honored to assist.",
            "Judge: That tea set looks quite cumbersome, so let's proceed without delay.",

            "Phoenix: \"Embrasser\"? That's French for \"kiss,\" isn't it?",
            "Bellboy: Correct, sir. But not a French kiss, sir! Just a gentle peck on the cheek.",
            "Phoenix: Wh-why would she have done that...?",
            "Bellboy: Perhaps she was momentarily charmed by my polished demeanor, sir.",

            "Phoenix: And you're absolutely certain of that?",

            "Bellboy: \"Oh, bellboy? Tee hee! I'd like my iced coffee at exactly 9:00!\" she said.",
            "Bellboy: So I made certain to knock on her door right as the clock struck 9:00.",

            "April: It's really... quite touching. Not! You stinking lawyer! I hope you rot!",
            "April: Have you come to laugh? Laugh at the fallen Miss May!?",
            "Phoenix: No, not really. There's just something I wanted to ask you.",
            "April: Oh, fantastic! Unfortunately, there's absolutely nothing I want to be ASKED. Haven't you interrogated me enough, you... spiky-haired pest!",
            "Phoenix: (Here we go again...) Please, you're scaring the poor security guard.",
            "April: ... So? What is it you want to ask me, then? Hmm?",
            "Phoenix: (For starters, how did you become so utterly unhinged!?)",
            "Bellboy: Ah, welcome, sir! Quite a splendid performance today, if I may say so!",
            "Phoenix: Oh, um, thanks. Sorry for putting you on the spot like that.",
            "Bellboy: Not at all, sir! Quite the opposite! Your dramatic display may even enhance the Gatewater's \"rep,\" as they say.",
            "Phoenix: Huh? \"Rep\"?",
            "Bellboy: Indeed! Our reputation as the hotel where the murderer used a wiretap! A little notoriety can go a long way. We could even charge a premium for the room!",
            "Phoenix: Whoa, whoa! Miss May hasn't been convicted of murder.",
            "Bellboy: Details, sir! I shall be remembered as \"The Bellboy who served iced coffee to a killer!\"",
            "Phoenix: (Why do I feel like we're both stuck in the same bizarre nightmare...?)",
            "Bellboy: So! Please consider yourself an honored guest. If there is anything I can provide, do let me know!",
            "Phoenix: Hmm. The bellboy seems to be out now... Wait, is that the sound of running water?",
            "Bellboy: La-dee-da! Money-Makin'... Money-Makin'... I got the Money-Makin' blues...",
            "Phoenix: (Someone's really enjoying their shower routine...)",
            "Phoenix: (Alright, this is getting absurd. Where has that loafer disappeared to?)",
            "Grossberg: *A-HHHHEM!*",
            "Phoenix: (Ah, that unmistakable throat-clearing sound...)",
            "Grossberg: Ah hah! You again.",
            "Phoenix: Um, hello, Mr. Grossberg.",
            "Grossberg: ... Well, well. You were quite something, my boy.",
            "Phoenix: Excuse me...?",
            "Grossberg: The trial! The trial!",
            "Phoenix: (He was watching...?)",
            "Grossberg: Reminded me of myself in my younger days!",
            "Phoenix: (Maybe Mia picked up something from this guy...)",
            "Grossberg: Brings back memories, it does! \"Ah... the days of my youth... like the scent of fresh lemon...\" you see. ... I apologize.",
            "Phoenix: ?",
            "Grossberg: I... It was a bit overwhelming for me, my boy. Watching you today, I... well, I... ...",
            "Phoenix: (I appreciate the nostalgia, but I could really use some useful information!)",
            "Phoenix: ... (And what is with this surreal décor...?)",
            "???: Welcome! Please, if you would be so kind, provide me with your esteemed title!",
            "Phoenix: (What in the world...?)",
            "White: Your name! What is your name? I was merely inquiring as to the designation you are known by.",
            "Phoenix: Uh... Wright. Phoenix Wright. (\"Inquiringly\"...?)",
            "White: Mr. Wright, is it? Right, I see... Splendiferous. Have I perhaps intimidated you with my giantesque vocabulary?",
            "Phoenix: (What is this guy's problem!?)",
            "White: I am Redd White, CEO of Bluecorp. You may have heard of us. Corporate Expansion Officials, as it were. My business deals bring me into contact with the upper echelon of society.",
            "White: I am therefore unaccustomed to conversing with the... lexically challenged.",
            "Phoenix: (What an absolute narcissist!)",
            "White: Hmmm, let me make an educated guess... You are an attorney fresh out of law school, are you not? What else could explain your decision to meet with me?",
            "Phoenix: (What's that supposed to mean?)",
            "White: But never mind. So tell me, what business does a \"mighty\" lawyer such as yourself have with someone like me?",
            "Phoenix: (Yikes! His arrogance is off the charts!)",
            "White: ... Mr. Wrong, was it?",
            "Phoenix: Wright.",
            "White: It seems you fail to grasp your position here. So, I ask again. Who are you?",
            "Phoenix: Uh... huh? A lawyer?",
            "White: No, my pitiful little friend. A \"mere\" lawyer. Insignificant. Worthless. A nobody! Just like that sorry excuse for an attorney, Grodyburger!",
            "Phoenix: (Wh-what!?) Ungh! Oof...! Ugh... (He... he punched me!)",
            "White: Well, Mr. Lawyer, what will you do now? Charge me with assault? Go on, I insist! I welcome it! For it is YOU who will end up guilty!",
            "Phoenix: What...?",
            "White: Listen closely. The police, the courts... they all dance to my tune.",
            "Phoenix: (So you claim... But can someone really have that kind of power?)",
            "White: I don't expect you to understand. It is a world beyond your comprehension. Tell me, you came here from Grodyburger's, yes?",
            "Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg's... yes.",
            "White: Then you should ask him: Why does his precious painting hang here in my office? Perhaps then, he will explain how a man can live a life driven purely by personal profit! ... Now go! Be gone! There is nothing more to discuss!",
            "White: Just what are you implying?",
            "Phoenix: Mia was on to you. She was investigating you. That's why you had April May tapping her phone. And then, Mia was murdered, and all the documents she had on you mysteriously vanished. So, the culprit would be...?",
            "White: ...",
            "Phoenix: Even a child could figure this out, Mr. White. You did it!",
            "White: ...",
            "Interphone: *beep* [Secretary's office.]",
            "White: We won't be needing an escort for Mr. Wrong. Instead, connect me to the public prosecutor's office.",
            "Interphone: [Of course, sir. One moment, please...] ... [White? Is that you? Why are you calling at a time like this!?]",
            "White: Hello. Chief Prosecutor? I've changed my mind. I want to testify tomorrow.",
            "Interphone: [Testify? About what?]",
            "White: The Mia Fey case. I witnessed the murder myself. And as a crucial witness, I would like to testify.",
            "Interphone: [What!? Why now? I thought you refused to appear in court!?]",
            "White: Silence! I told you, I changed my mind. Oh, and one more thing... Send the police here immediately. There is a man standing before me who is likely dangerous.",
            "Interphone: [What? Who?]",
            "White: Are you deaf? The executioner! The hatchet-man! The liquidator... The killer, standing right here!",
            "Phoenix: What!?",
            "Interphone: [Mr. White... this isn't another one of your games, is it?]",
            "White: Chief Prosecutor, you are in no position to question me. Now, send the police. Immediately.",
            "Interphone: *beep*",
            "White: Did I not tell you, Mr. Wrong? You are nothing but a \"mere lawyer,\" just like Miss Mia.",
            "Phoenix: How dare you!",
            "White: I will point the finger at you, and you will be tried as Miss Mia's killer! The case is already decided. No respectable lawyer will defend you. My influence over the local bar association will ensure that.",
            "White: You'll be assigned a defense attorney so utterly incompetent that they will make you look skilled by comparison.",
            "Phoenix: (I... I feel faint.)",
            "Gumshoe: Detective Gumshoe, reporting, sir! Huh!? Butz! Hairy Butz!",
            "Phoenix: Wright, actually. Phoenix Wright. And my friend's name is \"Larry\"...",
            "Gumshoe: Oh, right! Sorry, pal. Butz was that first suspect, right?",
            "White: Detective Gumshoe. I present to you the man who killed Miss Mia Fey!",
            "Gumshoe: W-what!?",
            "White: Take this wretched criminal into custody. ... Farewell, Mr. Wrong!",
            "Phoenix: I can't believe it's only been a single day since the first trial. My trial is tomorrow. White's going to set a trap for me... and the prosecution will be in on it. Edgeworth included.",
            "Phoenix: The state assigned me an attorney yesterday. I turned them down. I had an idea.",
            "Maya: ... Wright! Mr. Wright!",
            "Phoenix: Maya! They let you out of detention!",
            "Maya: Just now, yes! And it's all thanks to you!",
            "Phoenix: Haha. Seems like we've switched places now.",
            "Maya: What? You mean... you're...?",
            "Phoenix: I explained everything to Maya.",
            "Maya: I can't believe it! How many lives does that man need to destroy before he's satisfied!? My mother... my sister... and now you!? This has gone too far!",
            "Maya: Mr. Wright, please... is there anything I can do?",
            "Phoenix: Um... well...",
            "Maya: Well... I guess this is it, then!",
            "Phoenix: Yeah. One way or another, this case will be settled today.",
            "Maya: Aaa! Ph-Phoenix! Look!",
            "Phoenix: (...! Prosecutor... Edgeworth.)",
            "Edgeworth: I received a call from the public prosecutor's office yesterday.",
            "Phoenix: ?",
            "Edgeworth: They informed me that, no matter what Mr. White says today, it will be considered the \"absolute truth.\" No matter how you challenge his testimony... if I raise an objection, the judge will side with me.",
            "Phoenix: (What, does White have the judge in his pocket, too!?)",
            "Phoenix: So... you're saying I'm already guilty. It's over before it begins?",
            "Edgeworth: ... I will do anything to secure my verdict, Mr. Wright. Anything.",
            "Maya: Why... Why!? How can you torment an innocent person like this!?",
            "Edgeworth: \"Innocent\"...? How can we be certain of that? The guilty always lie to escape exposure. There is no way to truly know who is guilty or innocent. My only option... is to ensure every defendant is declared \"guilty.\" That is my creed.",
            "Phoenix: Edgeworth... You've changed.",
            "Maya: Hmm? Phoenix! You know him!?",
            "Edgeworth: Don't expect any special treatment, Phoenix Wright.",
            "Maya: Ph-Phoenix...?",
            "Phoenix: Well... court will be starting soon.",
            "Maya: Wait! But... Your defense attorney isn't even here yet! They're not...?",
            "Phoenix: I'm defending myself.",
            "Maya: Whaaaat!?",
            "Phoenix: Okay, Maya. Let's do this.",
            "Judge: The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Phoenix Wright.",
            "Edgeworth: The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.",
            "Phoenix: The defense is ready, Your Honor.",
            "Judge: Mr. Wright... Are you certain you wish to proceed without an attorney?",
            "Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. I will be defending myself.",
            "Judge: Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.",
            "Edgeworth: Since the details of the incident are already well-known to the court, today we will focus on the testimony of an eyewitness to the defendant's crime.",
            "Judge: Understood. The prosecution may call its witness.",
            "Phoenix: (That was far too smooth! Why didn't the judge question why this witness is only appearing now!? It's almost as if... he already knows the reason! If anyone is going to object, I guess it has to be me...)",
            "Edgeworth: The prosecution would like to call Mr. Redd White to the stand.",
            "Edgeworth: Witness, please state your full name.",
            "White: You wish to know the title of my personage?",
            "Edgeworth: Er... just your name will do.",
            "White: Ah, but of course! Names are such trivialities, yet I shall indulge you. My name is Redd White. Some call me Blanco Nino. I am the CEO — or to be pedestrian, the President — of Bluecorp.",
            "Edgeworth: Did you know the victim, Ms. Mia Fey?",
            "White: That would be a negatory! No, I did not.",
            "Edgeworth: ... You were present at the Gatewater Hotel on the night of the murder, were you not?",
            "White: Indeed.",
            "Edgeworth: And you witnessed the crime from there?",
            "White: Oh, must I repeat what is already known? But of course.",
            "Judge: Very well, Mr. White. You may begin your testimony.",
            "Phoenix: (If I can't tear this man's testimony apart, I'm finished. Why do I always feel like I'm standing alone against the end of the world?)",
            "White: Ho hoh hoh. I hope you have made your peace with your maker, Mr. Lawyer!",
            "Phoenix: ...!",
            "Maya: Don't let him intimidate you, Phoenix!",
            "System: Witness Testimony -- Witness's Account --",
            "White: Let me see... it was around 9:00 PM, if I recall.",
            "White: I was quietly perusifying — ah, that is, reading — some documents by the window.",
            "White: Suddenly, I heard a commotion from outside!",
            "White: Surprised, I looked towards the building across the way.",
            "White: That's when I saw him: a spiky-haired man attacking a woman with long hair!",
            "White: Needless to say, that man was none other than you, Mr. Lawyer!",
            "White: I immediately called Miss May over. She, too, was shocked, of course.",
            "White: The victim tried to escape, but you pursued her!",
            "White: Finally, there was a dreadful impact... and then... it was over.",
            "Judge: Hmm... If events transpired as you have testified, then I'm afraid the defendant is indeed guilty.",
            "Judge: Very well, Mr. Wright... I mean, Mr. Defendant... Your cross-examination.",
            "Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor.",
            "White: Let's see, it was around 9:00 PM, I believe.",
            "White: I was quietly... perusifying... er, that means \"reading,\" some documents by the window.",
            "White: Suddenly, I heard a commotion coming from outside!",
            "White: Startled, I turned to look at the building across the way.",
            "White: That's when I saw him: a spiky-haired man attacking a woman with long hair!",
            "White: And needless to say, that man was none other than you, Mr. Lawyer!",
            "White: I immediately called Miss May over. She, too, was shocked.",
            "White: The victim... she tried to run, but you chased after her!",
            "Phoenix: Can you clarify that a bit more?",
            "Phoenix: I think it's crucial we know exactly what happened.",
            "White: But of course! Crystal clear!",
            "White: The victim was attacked — by you — and ran to the left.",
            "White: You gave chase and struck her down!",
            "Edgeworth: Are you absolutely certain?",
            "White: As you know, I am always abso-posi-lutely certain!",
            "Judge: Perhaps you could amend your testimony to include this detail.",
            "White: Very well! The victim ran to the left, and you pursued her!",
            "Phoenix: I present the May Testimony.",
            "Phoenix: Hold it right there, Mr. White!",
            "White: What is this now!?",
            "Phoenix: You just dug your own grave!",
            "Phoenix: You claim the victim ran to the \"left.\"",
            "Phoenix: But that directly contradicts Miss May's testimony!",
            "Phoenix: She explicitly stated that the victim ran to the \"right\"!",
            "White: ...!",
            "White: Oh hoh hoh! Surely, you have misheard her.",
            "Phoenix: I think not.",
            "Phoenix: Let's consult the floor plans...",
            "Phoenix: The attacker was here.",
            "Phoenix: And the victim was here.",
            "Phoenix: If the victim ran to the left, as you claim...",
            "Phoenix: She would have been running directly away from the door!",
            "Phoenix: She would have been trapped, running into a dead end!",
            "Phoenix: Doesn't that strike you as... strange?",
            "White: !",
            "White: Very strange indeed...",
            "White: But I know what I saw. She ran to the left... I swear it.",
            "Maya: Phoenix... look at his face. I don't think he's lying about this.",
            "Phoenix: You might be right.",
            "Phoenix: (Could he really have seen the victim run left...?)",
            "Phoenix: (Which means... he did witness the crime...?)",
            "Phoenix: (Wait a second!)",
            "Judge: Mr. Wright?",
            "Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor?",
            "Judge: We have two conflicting statements. Miss May claims the victim ran \"right,\" while Mr. White insists she ran \"left.\"",
            "Judge: Can you explain this contradiction?",
            "Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor.",
            "Phoenix: As Miss May testified, Mia ran to the right after being attacked.",
            "White: What nonsense! I am not fabricating tales, I assure you!",
            "White: The woman ran to the left! I am certain of it!",
            "Phoenix: Then there can only be one explanation.",
            "Edgeworth: Oh? And what would that be?",
            "Phoenix: The witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel at all!",
            "Judge: Mr. Wright! What are you implying?",
            "Edgeworth: Yes, clarify! If Mr. White was not watching from the hotel, then where was he?",
            "Phoenix: He was in the Fey & Co. Law Offices themselves!",
            "Phoenix: This is exactly where he was! Look at the floor plan! When the victim ran for the door...",
            "Phoenix: If he was standing here, it would appear to him that she was running to the 'left.'",
            "Edgeworth: Ridiculous! This is no time for tasteless jokes, Mr. Wright!",
            "Edgeworth: That spot is where the killer was standing!",

            "Judge: I will not tolerate disorder in this courtroom! Mr. Wright, what exactly are you suggesting!?",
            "White: Y-you insolent rapscallion!!!",
            "Edgeworth: Your Honor, the defense's claims are a blatant misrepresentation of the facts!",
            "Judge: Indeed. They do appear rather... far-fetched.",
            "White: ... Oh hoh hoh hoh! Truly, Mr. Lawyer, your antics are most entertaining!",
            "Phoenix: (What now!? Why is he laughing!?)",
            "White: Ah, but this mirth has jogged my memory... It seems I may have been unclear in my testimony.",
            "White: For that, I must humbly apologize.",
            "White: Your Honor, might I be permitted to clarify my account one final time?",
            "Judge: Very well. Let's hear your revised testimony.",
            "Phoenix: (Good luck. You can't patch up a broken story forever!)",
            "White: Allow me to explain. Both Miss May's testimony and my own were accurate.",
            "White: You see, when you attacked the woman, she first ran to the left.",
            "White: At that moment, you struck her! A vicious blow! That is what I saw.",
            "White: But then, with the last of her strength, she ran to the right.",
            "White: You chased her and struck her down with the final blow.",
            "White: That is what Miss May witnessed from her vantage point.",
            "White: In other words, you hit her twice!",
            "White: Don't you remember, Mr. Lawyer?",
            "Judge: Hmm... This testimony does seem to reconcile the two accounts. Will you be cross-examining the witness's statement, Mr. Wright?",

            "Phoenix: Then there can only be one explanation.",

            "Judge: Mr. Wright! What are you implying?",
            "Edgeworth: Yes, clarify! If Mr. White was not watching from the hotel, then where was he?",
            "Phoenix: He was in the Fey & Co. Law Offices themselves!",
            "Phoenix: This is exactly where he was! Look at the floor plan! When the victim ran for the door...",

            "Phoenix: (What now!? Why is he laughing!?)",
            "White: Ah, but this mirth has jogged my memory... It seems I may have been unclear in my testimony.",
            "White: For that, I must humbly apologize.",
            "White: Your Honor, might I be permitted to clarify my account one final time?",
            "Judge: Very well. Let's hear your revised testimony.",
            "Phoenix: (Good luck. You can't patch up a broken story forever!)",
            "White: Allow me to explain. Both Miss May's testimony and my own were accurate.",
            "White: You see, when you attacked the woman, she first ran to the left.",
            "White: At that moment, you struck her! A vicious blow! That is what I saw.",
            "White: But then, with the last of her strength, she ran to the right.",
            "White: You chased her and struck her down with the final blow.",

            "White: Don't you remember, Mr. Lawyer?",
            "Judge: Hmm... This testimony does seem to reconcile the two accounts. Will you be cross-examining the witness's statement, Mr. Wright?",

            "White: Umm... and then...",
            "White: She turned, and ran for the door!",
            "White: Then you did her in with a single blow! Thwap!",
            "Judge: Hmm. \"Thwap\" indeed. Very well, you may begin the cross-examination.",

            "White: Finally, there was a dreadful impact... and then... it was over.",
            "Judge: Hmm... If events transpired as you have testified, then I'm afraid the defendant is indeed guilty.",
            "Judge: Very well, Mr. Wright... I mean, Mr. Defendant... Your cross-examination.",
            "Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor.",
            "White: Let's see, it was around 9:00 PM, I believe.",
            "White: I was quietly... perusifying... er, that means \"reading,\" some documents by the window.",
            "White: Suddenly, I heard a commotion coming from outside!",
            "White: Startled, I turned to look at the building across the way.",
            "White: That's when I saw him: a spiky-haired man attacking a woman with long hair!",
            "White: And needless to say, that man was none other than you, Mr. Lawyer!",
            "White: I immediately called Miss May over. She, too, was shocked.",
            "White: The victim... she tried to run, but you chased after her!",
            "Phoenix: Can you clarify that a bit more?",
            "Phoenix: I think it's crucial we know exactly what happened.",
            "White: But of course! Crystal clear!",
            "White: The victim was attacked — by you — and ran to the left.",
            "White: You gave chase and struck her down!",
            "Edgeworth: Are you absolutely certain?",
            "White: As you know, I am always abso-posi-lutely certain!",
            "Judge: Perhaps you could amend your testimony to include this detail.",
            "White: Very well! The victim ran to the left, and you pursued her!",
            "Phoenix: I present the May Testimony.",
            "Phoenix: Hold it right there, Mr. White!",
            "White: What is this now!?",
            "Phoenix: You just dug your own grave!",
            "Phoenix: You claim the victim ran to the \"left.\"",
            "Phoenix: But that directly contradicts Miss May's testimony!",
            "Phoenix: She explicitly stated that the victim ran to the \"right\"!",
            "White: ...!",
            "White: Oh hoh hoh! Surely, you have misheard her.",
            "Phoenix: I think not.",
            "Phoenix: Let's consult the floor plans...",
            "Phoenix: The attacker was here.",
            "Phoenix: And the victim was here.",
            "Phoenix: If the victim ran to the left, as you claim...",
            "Phoenix: She would have been running directly away from the door!",
            "Phoenix: She would have been trapped, running into a dead end!",
            "Phoenix: Doesn't that strike you as... strange?",
            "White: !",
            "White: Very strange indeed...",
            "White: But I know what I saw. She ran to the left... I swear it.",
            "Maya: Phoenix... look at his face. I don't think he's lying about this.",
            "Phoenix: You might be right.",
            "Phoenix: (Could he really have seen the victim run left...?)",
            "Phoenix: (Which means... he did witness the crime...?)",
            "Phoenix: (Wait a second!)",
            "Judge: Mr. Wright?",
            "Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor?",
            "Judge: We have two conflicting statements. Miss May claims the victim ran \"right,\" while Mr. White insists she ran \"left.\"",
            "Judge: Can you explain this contradiction?",
            "Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor.",
            "Phoenix: As Miss May testified, Mia ran to the right after being attacked.",
            "White: What nonsense! I am not fabricating tales, I assure you!",
            "White: The woman ran to the left! I am certain of it!",
            "Phoenix: Then there can only be one explanation.",
            "Edgeworth: Oh? And what would that be?",
            "Phoenix: The witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel at all!",
            "Judge: Mr. Wright! What are you implying?",
            "Edgeworth: Yes, clarify! If Mr. White was not watching from the hotel, then where was he?",
            "Phoenix: He was in the Fey & Co. Law Offices themselves!",
            "Phoenix: This is exactly where he was! Look at the floor plan! When the victim ran for the door...",
            "Phoenix: If he was standing here, it would appear to him that she was running to the 'left.'",
            "Edgeworth: Ridiculous! This is no time for tasteless jokes, Mr. Wright!",
            "Edgeworth: That spot is where the killer was standing!",
            "Judge: Order! Order in the court!",
            "Judge: I will not tolerate disorder in this courtroom! Mr. Wright, what exactly are you suggesting!?",
            "White: Y-you insolent rapscallion!!!",
            "Edgeworth: Your Honor, the defense's claims are a blatant misrepresentation of the facts!",
            "Judge: Indeed. They do appear rather... far-fetched.",
            "White: ... Oh hoh hoh hoh! Truly, Mr. Lawyer, your antics are most entertaining!",
            "Phoenix: (What now!? Why is he laughing!?)",
            "White: Ah, but this mirth has jogged my memory... It seems I may have been unclear in my testimony.",
            "White: For that, I must humbly apologize.",
            "White: Your Honor, might I be permitted to clarify my account one final time?",
            "Judge: Very well. Let's hear your revised testimony.",
            "Phoenix: (Good luck. You can't patch up a broken story forever!)",
            "White: Allow me to explain. Both Miss May's testimony and my own were accurate.",
            "White: You see, when you attacked the woman, she first ran to the left.",
            "White: At that moment, you struck her! A vicious blow! That is what I saw.",
            "White: But then, with the last of her strength, she ran to the right.",
            "White: You chased her and struck her down with the final blow.",
            "White: That is what Miss May witnessed from her vantage point.",
            "White: In other words, you hit her twice!",
            "White: Don't you remember, Mr. Lawyer?",
            "Judge: Hmm... This testimony does seem to reconcile the two accounts. Will you be cross-examining the witness's statement, Mr. Wright?",
            "Phoenix: You bet I will! I mean, yes, Your Honor.",
            "Phoenix: The victim died from a single blow!",
            "White: ...!",
            "Phoenix: What do you have to say to that?",
            "White: Er... Erp!",
            "Phoenix: (Now's my chance to hit him where it counts!)",
            "Phoenix: Mr. White. Wasn bv't it you who told this court you were \"abso-posi-lutely perfect\"?",
            "White: Mmph.",
            "White: I will refrain from using this phrase from now on.",
            "Phoenix: Your Honor, if you could ask the witness for a new testimony...",
            "Edgeworth: The witness is obviously confused, Your Honor!",
            "Edgeworth: I would like to request a 10 minute break!",
            "Judge: Yes... yes, quite.",
            "Phoenix: The witness is confused because he's lying!",
            "Phoenix: I emphatically request that there be no break, Your Honor!",
            "Judge: If the witness would care to revise his testimony...",
            "Phoenix: (The crowd's on my side! No slipping out of this now, White!)",
            "Judge: Mr. White?",
            "White: O... okay...",
            "White: Umm, well, see--I looked at the other window when I heard that thing fall.",
            "White: Then, the next moment, I saw Miss Mia run to the left!",
            "White: The killer, you, attacked her... but she dodged.",
            "White: Umm... and then...",
            "White: She turned, and ran for the door!",
            "White: Then you did her in with a single blow! Thwap!",
            "Judge: Hmm. \"Thwap\" indeed. Very well, you may begin the cross-examination.",
            "White: Mr. Your Honor... My stomach, you see, it is hurting...",
            "Phoenix: Deal with it. This is almost over.",
            "Judge: These are the floor plans to the scene of the murder, yes?",
            "Phoenix: Correct, Your Honor. Now, look...",
            "Phoenix: If you were to look through the window at the office...",
            "Phoenix: This is the area you would be able to see!",
            "Phoenix: Here!",
            "Phoenix: Well...?",
            "Phoenix: Note that the stand is not within the visible area!",
            "Phoenix: Well, Mr. White!",
            "Phoenix: What do you have to say to that!?",
            "White: Er... erp!",
            "White: Ri... dicu... losity...",
            "Phoenix: If you were in the Gatewater Hotel as you claim,",
            "Phoenix: you could not have seen the stand before it fell over!",
            "Phoenix: In fact, you wouldn't have been able to see it after it fell, either!",
            "Phoenix: There's no way you could have recognized the broken shards as a glass light stand!",
            "Phoenix: So, when did you see the stand, Mr. White?",
            "Phoenix: It must have been the moment that it fell!",
            "Phoenix: And the only place you could have seen that from... is inside the Fey Law Offices!",
            "Phoenix: In other words, you were at the scene of the crime, when the murder took place!",
            "White: ...",
            "Phoenix: You did it, didn't you?",
            "White: Mr. Your Honor.",
            "White: I... I... Miss Mia...",
            "Phoenix: (Heh. Looks like we're about to get our verdict!)",
            "Edgeworth: That's far enough, Phoenix Wright!",
            "Phoenix: W-what!? (Urk! I forgot about Edgeworth!)",
            "Edgeworth: Mr. White...",
            "Edgeworth: I think the time has come.",
            "Edgeworth: Shouldn't you confess your crime now, hmm?",
            "White: W... what?",
            "Edgeworth: I said, you should confess your crime.",
            "Edgeworth: Ergo,",
            "Edgeworth: confess that you placed the wiretap!",

            "Judge: Order! Order",
            "Judge: Mr. Edgeworth! Explain to the court what you mean by this!",
            "Edgeworth: Distinguished members of the court...",
            "Edgeworth: Mr. White is slightly confused.",
            "Edgeworth: Allow me to explain.",
            "Phoenix: (I really don't like the way this is headed...)",
            "Edgeworth: As you know, Mr. White is the CEO of Bluecorp.",
            "Edgeworth: He ordered his secretary, Miss April May, to tap the law offices of Ms. Fey.",
            "Judge: What does that have to do...?",
            "Edgeworth: Your Honor.",
            "Edgeworth: The question is: when was the wiretap placed in the office, and by who?",
            "Phoenix: No! You wouldn't!",
            "Edgeworth: Mr. White.",
            "Edgeworth: In order to place the wiretap, you entered Ms. Fey's office.",
            "Edgeworth: Am I correct...?",
            "White: !",
            "White: C-correct! You are most correct, Miles!",
            "White: Yes... in order to place the wiretap, I bre",
            "White: That is when I saw that accursed light stand!",
            "Judge: Now I'm confus",
            "Edgeworth: Gladly, Your Honor.",
            "Edgeworth: Mr. Phoenix Wright has made his position quite clear.",
            "Edgeworth: He has determined that Mr. White knew the glass stand was in the office.",
            "Edgeworth: He has shown that there was only one time Mr. White could have seen the stand:",
            "Edgeworth: at the very moment of the murder!",
            "Edgeworth: Thus, Mr. Wright would like you to believe that Mr. White was the murderer!",
            "Judge: I see.",
            "Edgeworth: However!",
            "Edgeworth: It is a fact that Mr. White had been to that office well before the murder took place!",
            "Edgeworth: When he went to place the wiretap!",
            "Edgeworth: He could have seen the glass light stand then.",
            "EDGEWORTH: Ergo, Mr. Phoenix Wright's theory is revealed for the baseless conjecture it is!",
            "Judge: Mr. White!",
            "Judge: You will testify to the court about this wiretapping!",
            "White: Ahem. Leave it to me!",
            "Phoenix: (I... I feel faint.)",
            "White: It was the beginning of September... the week before the murder.",
            "White: I had entered the Fey & Co. Law Offices.",
            "White: Of course, I had done so to place the wiretap.",
            "White: That is when I saw this glass light stand.",
            "Judge: Hmm... So, you saw the stand before the night of the incident... And this is how you were able to identify what had fallen over. By the sound?",
            "White: Correct! That is right.",
            "Judge: I see. Very well, Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine.",
            "Edgeworth: Tsk tsk. I'm afraid that's as far as you go, Mr. Wright. The time has come for you to admit your defeat! You fought... honorably.",
            "Phoenix: (No more... I can't take this anymore...)",
            "Judge: Mr. Wright? Are you giving up?",
            "Phoenix: ... Y-yes, Your Honor.",
            "???: (Phoenix!)",
            "Phoenix: ...?",

            "Phoenix: I was... hallucinating. ...",
            "Mia: Ah, you're finally awake.",

            "Mia: Didn't you know the Fey women have strong psychic powers...? ",
            "Mia: When you accepted your defeat in court... It appears that was enough of a shock to awaken Maya's true powers.",
            "Phoenix: So... Maya is channeling you, Mia?",
            "Mia: That's right. I am Maya, but I'm also Mia. ",
            "Mia: Now, I want you to listen to me, Phoenix.",
            "Mia: Maya never gave up. You can't either!",
            "Mia: That's what I came here to tell you.",

            "Mia: You've already won.",
            "Phoenix: Huh...?",
            "Mia: You have that Receipt in the court record, right?",
            "Phoenix: Um... oh, yeah! The one you wrote \"Maya\" on...?",
            "Mia: Phoenix! White wrote that, not me!",
            "Phoenix: So... so what do I do with it?",
            "Mia: Look at the front of the receipt!",
            "Phoenix: The... front?",
            "Phoenix: (It's a regular receipt... Looks like it's from a famous department store. ",

            "Mia: I bought that stand the day before I was killed!",
            "Phoenix: Whoa!",
            "Mia: Now, what did Mr. White say in his testimony?",
            "White: It was the beginning of September... the week before the murder.",
            "Phoenix: He said he saw the stand the week before the murder!",
            "Mia: There you go!.",
            "Mia: I think the court is about to reconvene!",
            "Mia: Go do it, Phoenix! You know you're innocent, now you just have to prove it!",
            "Phoenix: Right!",

            "Phoenix: Um... well...",
            "Maya: Well... I guess this is it, then!",
            "Phoenix: Yeah. One way or another, this case will be settled today.",
            "Maya: Aaa! Ph-Phoenix! Look!",
            "Phoenix: (...! Prosecutor... Edgeworth.)",
            "Edgeworth: I received a call from the public prosecutor's office yesterday.",
            "Phoenix: ?",
            "Edgeworth: They informed me that, no matter what Mr. White says today, it will be considered the \"absolute truth.\" No matter how you challenge his testimony... if I raise an objection, the judge will side with me.",
            "Phoenix: (What, does White have the judge in his pocket, too!?)",
            "Phoenix: So... you're saying I'm already guilty. It's over before it begins?",
            "Edgeworth: ... I will do anything to secure my verdict, Mr. Wright. Anything.",
            "Maya: Why... Why!? How can you torment an innocent person like this!?",
            "Edgeworth: \"Innocent\"...? How can we be certain of that? The guilty always lie to escape exposure. There is no way to truly know who is guilty or innocent. My only option... is to ensure every defendant is declared \"guilty.\" That is my creed.",
            "Phoenix: Edgeworth... You've changed.",
            "Maya: Hmm? Phoenix! You know him!?",
            "Edgeworth: Don't expect any special treatment, Phoenix Wright.",
            "Maya: Ph-Phoenix...?",
            "Phoenix: Well... court will be starting soon.",
            "Maya: Wait! But... Your defense attorney isn't even here yet! They're not...?",
            "Phoenix: I'm defending myself.",
            "Maya: Whaaaat!?",
            "Phoenix: Okay, Maya. Let's do this.",
            "Judge: The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Phoenix Wright.",
            "Edgeworth: The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.",
            "Phoenix: The defense is ready, Your Honor.",
            "Judge: Mr. Wright... Are you certain you wish to proceed without an attorney?",
            "Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. I will be defending myself.",
            "Judge: Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.",
            "Edgeworth: Since the details of the incident are already well-known to the court, today we will focus on the testimony of an eyewitness to the defendant's crime.",
            "Judge: Understood. The prosecution may call its witness.",
            "Phoenix: (That was far too smooth! Why didn't the judge question why this witness is only appearing now!? It's almost as if... he already knows the reason! If anyone is going to object, I guess it has to be me...)",
            "Edgeworth: The prosecution would like to call Mr. Redd White to the stand.",
            "Edgeworth: Witness, please state your full name.",
            "White: You wish to know the title of my personage?",
            "Edgeworth: Er... just your name will do.",
            "White: Ah, but of course! Names are such trivialities, yet I shall indulge you. My name is Redd White. Some call me Blanco Nino. I am the CEO — or to be pedestrian, the President — of Bluecorp.",
            "Edgeworth: Did you know the victim, Ms. Mia Fey?",
            "White: That would be a negatory! No, I did not.",
            "Edgeworth: ... You were present at the Gatewater Hotel on the night of the murder, were you not?",
            "White: Indeed.",
            "Edgeworth: And you witnessed the crime from there?",
            "White: Oh, must I repeat what is already known? But of course.",
            "Judge: Very well, Mr. White. You may begin your testimony.",
            "Phoenix: (If I can't tear this man's testimony apart, I'm finished. Why do I always feel like I'm standing alone against the end of the world?)",
            "White: Ho hoh hoh. I hope you have made your peace with your maker, Mr. Lawyer!",
            "Phoenix: ...!",
            "Maya: Don't let him intimidate you, Phoenix!",
            "System: Witness Testimony -- Witness's Account --",
            "White: Let me see... it was around 9:00 PM, if I recall.",
            "White: I was quietly perusifying — ah, that is, reading — some documents by the window.",
            "White: Suddenly, I heard a commotion from outside!",
            "White: Surprised, I looked towards the building across the way.",
            "White: That's when I saw him: a spiky-haired man attacking a woman with long hair!",
            "White: Needless to say, that man was none other than you, Mr. Lawyer!",
            "White: I immediately called Miss May over. She, too, was shocked, of course.",
            "White: The victim tried to escape, but you pursued her!",
            "White: Finally, there was a dreadful impact... and then... it was over.",
            "Judge: Hmm... If events transpired as you have testified, then I'm afraid the defendant is indeed guilty.",
            "Judge: Very well, Mr. Wright... I mean, Mr. Defendant... Your cross-examination.",
            "Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor.",
            "White: Let's see, it was around 9:00 PM, I believe.",
            "White: I was quietly... perusifying... er, that means \"reading,\" some documents by the window.",
            "White: Suddenly, I heard a commotion coming from outside!",
            "White: Startled, I turned to look at the building across the way.",
            "White: That's when I saw him: a spiky-haired man attacking a woman with long hair!",
            "White: And needless to say, that man was none other than you, Mr. Lawyer!",
            "White: I immediately called Miss May over. She, too, was shocked.",
            "White: The victim... she tried to run, but you chased after her!",
            "Phoenix: Can you clarify that a bit more?",
            "Phoenix: I think it's crucial we know exactly what happened.",
            "White: But of course! Crystal clear!",
            "White: The victim was attacked — by you — and ran to the left.",
            "White: You gave chase and struck her down!",
            "Edgeworth: Are you absolutely certain?",
            "White: As you know, I am always abso-posi-lutely certain!",
            "Judge: Perhaps you could amend your testimony to include this detail.",
            "White: Very well! The victim ran to the left, and you pursued her!",
            "Phoenix: I present the May Testimony.",
            "Phoenix: Hold it right there, Mr. White!",
            "White: What is this now!?",
            "Phoenix: You just dug your own grave!",
            "Phoenix: You claim the victim ran to the \"left.\"",
            "Phoenix: But that directly contradicts Miss May's testimony!",
            "Phoenix: She explicitly stated that the victim ran to the \"right\"!",
            "White: ...!",
            "White: Oh hoh hoh! Surely, you have misheard her.",
            "Phoenix: I think not.",
            "Phoenix: Let's consult the floor plans...",
            "Phoenix: The attacker was here.",
            "Phoenix: And the victim was here.",
            "Phoenix: If the victim ran to the left, as you claim...",
            "Phoenix: She would have been running directly away from the door!",
            "Phoenix: She would have been trapped, running into a dead end!",
            "Phoenix: Doesn't that strike you as... strange?",
            "White: !",
            "White: Very strange indeed...",
            "White: But I know what I saw. She ran to the left... I swear it.",
            "Maya: Phoenix... look at his face. I don't think he's lying about this.",
            "Phoenix: You might be right.",
            "Phoenix: (Could he really have seen the victim run left...?)",
            "Phoenix: (Which means... he did witness the crime...?)",
            "Phoenix: (Wait a second!)",
            "Judge: Mr. Wright?",
            "Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor?",
            "Judge: We have two conflicting statements. Miss May claims the victim ran \"right,\" while Mr. White insists she ran \"left.\"",
            "Judge: Can you explain this contradiction?",
            "Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor.",
            "Phoenix: As Miss May testified, Mia ran to the right after being attacked.",
            "White: What nonsense! I am not fabricating tales, I assure you!",
            "White: The woman ran to the left! I am certain of it!",
            "Phoenix: Then there can only be one explanation.",
            "Edgeworth: Oh? And what would that be?",
            "Phoenix: The witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel at all!",
            "Judge: Mr. Wright! What are you implying?",
            "Edgeworth: Yes, clarify! If Mr. White was not watching from the hotel, then where was he?",
            "Phoenix: He was in the Fey & Co. Law Offices themselves!",
            "Phoenix: This is exactly where he was! Look at the floor plan! When the victim ran for the door...",
            "Phoenix: If he was standing here, it would appear to him that she was running to the 'left.'",
            "Edgeworth: Ridiculous! This is no time for tasteless jokes, Mr. Wright!",
            "Edgeworth: That spot is where the killer was standing!",
            "Judge: Order! Order in the court!",
            "Judge: I will not tolerate disorder in this courtroom! Mr. Wright, what exactly are you suggesting!?",
            "White: Y-you insolent rapscallion!!!",
            "Edgeworth: Your Honor, the defense's claims are a blatant misrepresentation of the facts!",
            "Judge: Indeed. They do appear rather... far-fetched.",
            "White: ... Oh hoh hoh hoh! Truly, Mr. Lawyer, your antics are most entertaining!",
            "Phoenix: (What now!? Why is he laughing!?)",
            "White: Ah, but this mirth has jogged my memory... It seems I may have been unclear in my testimony.",
            "White: For that, I must humbly apologize.",
            "White: Your Honor, might I be permitted to clarify my account one final time?",
            "Judge: Very well. Let's hear your revised testimony.",
            "Phoenix: (Good luck. You can't patch up a broken story forever!)",
            "White: Allow me to explain. Both Miss May's testimony and my own were accurate.",
            "White: You see, when you attacked the woman, she first ran to the left.",
            "White: At that moment, you struck her! A vicious blow! That is what I saw.",
            "White: But then, with the last of her strength, she ran to the right.",
            "White: You chased her and struck her down with the final blow.",
            "White: That is what Miss May witnessed from her vantage point.",
            "White: In other words, you hit her twice!",
            "White: Don't you remember, Mr. Lawyer?",
            "Judge: Hmm... This testimony does seem to reconcile the two accounts. Will you be cross-examining the witness's statement, Mr. Wright?",
            "Phoenix: You bet I will! I mean, yes, Your Honor.",
            "Phoenix: The victim died from a single blow!",
            "White: ...!",
            "Phoenix: What do you have to say to that?",
            "White: Er... Erp!",
            "Phoenix: (Now's my chance to hit him where it counts!)",
            "Phoenix: Mr. White. Wasn bv't it you who told this court you were \"abso-posi-lutely perfect\"?",
            "White: Mmph.",
            "White: I will refrain from using this phrase from now on.",
            "Phoenix: Your Honor, if you could ask the witness for a new testimony...",
            "Edgeworth: The witness is obviously confused, Your Honor!",
            "Edgeworth: I would like to request a 10 minute break!",
            "Judge: Yes... yes, quite.",
            "Phoenix: The witness is confused because he's lying!",
            "Phoenix: I emphatically request that there be no break, Your Honor!",
            "Judge: If the witness would care to revise his testimony...",
            "Phoenix: (The crowd's on my side! No slipping out of this now, White!)",
            "Judge: Mr. White?",
            "White: O... okay...",
            "White: Umm, well, see--I looked at the other window when I heard that thing fall.",
            "White: Then, the next moment, I saw Miss Mia run to the left!",
            "White: The killer, you, attacked her... but she dodged.",
            "White: Umm... and then...",
            "White: She turned, and ran for the door!",
            "White: Then you did her in with a single blow! Thwap!",
            "Judge: Hmm. \"Thwap\" indeed. Very well, you may begin the cross-examination.",
            "White: Mr. Your Honor... My stomach, you see, it is hurting...",
            "Phoenix: Deal with it. This is almost over.",
            "Judge: These are the floor plans to the scene of the murder, yes?",
            "Phoenix: Correct, Your Honor. Now, look...",
            "Phoenix: If you were to look through the window at the office...",
            "Phoenix: This is the area you would be able to see!",
            "Phoenix: Here!",
            "Phoenix: Well...?",
            "Phoenix: Note that the stand is not within the visible area!",
            "Phoenix: Well, Mr. White!",
            "Phoenix: What do you have to say to that!?",
            "White: Er... erp!",
            "White: Ri... dicu... losity...",
            "Phoenix: If you were in the Gatewater Hotel as you claim,",
            "Phoenix: you could not have seen the stand before it fell over!",
            "Phoenix: In fact, you wouldn't have been able to see it after it fell, either!",
            "Phoenix: There's no way you could have recognized the broken shards as a glass light stand!",
            "Phoenix: So, when did you see the stand, Mr. White?",
            "Phoenix: It must have been the moment that it fell!",
            "Phoenix: And the only place you could have seen that from... is inside the Fey Law Offices!",
            "Phoenix: In other words, you were at the scene of the crime, when the murder took place!",
            "White: ...",
            "Phoenix: You did it, didn't you?",
            "White: Mr. Your Honor.",
            "White: I... I... Miss Mia...",
            "Phoenix: (Heh. Looks like we're about to get our verdict!)",
            "Edgeworth: That's far enough, Phoenix Wright!",
            "Phoenix: W-what!? (Urk! I forgot about Edgeworth!)",
            "Edgeworth: Mr. White...",
            "Edgeworth: I think the time has come.",
            "Edgeworth: Shouldn't you confess your crime now, hmm?",
            "White: W... what?",
            "Edgeworth: I said, you should confess your crime.",
            "Edgeworth: Ergo,",
            "Edgeworth: confess that you placed the wiretap!",
            "Phoenix: The w-wiretap!?",
            "Judge: Order! Order",
            "Judge: Mr. Edgeworth! Explain to the court what you mean by this!",
            "Edgeworth: Distinguished members of the court...",
            "Edgeworth: Mr. White is slightly confused.",
            "Edgeworth: Allow me to explain.",
            "Phoenix: (I really don't like the way this is headed...)",
            "Edgeworth: As you know, Mr. White is the CEO of Bluecorp.",
            "Edgeworth: He ordered his secretary, Miss April May, to tap the law offices of Ms. Fey.",
            "Judge: What does that have to do...?",
            "Edgeworth: Your Honor.",
            "Edgeworth: The question is: when was the wiretap placed in the office, and by who?",
            "Phoenix: No! You wouldn't!",
            "Edgeworth: Mr. White.",
            "Edgeworth: In order to place the wiretap, you entered Ms. Fey's office.",
            "Edgeworth: Am I correct...?",
            "White: !",
            "White: C-correct! You are most correct, Miles!",
            "White: Yes... in order to place the wiretap, I bre",
            "White: That is when I saw that accursed light stand!",
            "Judge: Now I'm confus",
            "Edgeworth: Gladly, Your Honor.",
            "Edgeworth: Mr. Phoenix Wright has made his position quite clear.",
            "Edgeworth: He has determined that Mr. White knew the glass stand was in the office.",
            "Edgeworth: He has shown that there was only one time Mr. White could have seen the stand:",
            "Edgeworth: at the very moment of the murder!",
            "Edgeworth: Thus, Mr. Wright would like you to believe that Mr. White was the murderer!",
            "Judge: I see.",
            "Edgeworth: However!",
            "Edgeworth: It is a fact that Mr. White had been to that office well before the murder took place!",
            "Edgeworth: When he went to place the wiretap!",
            "Edgeworth: He could have seen the glass light stand then.",
            "EDGEWORTH: Ergo, Mr. Phoenix Wright's theory is revealed for the baseless conjecture it is!",
            "Judge: Mr. White!",
            "Judge: You will testify to the court about this wiretapping!",
            "White: Ahem. Leave it to me!",
            "Phoenix: (I... I feel faint.)",
            "White: It was the beginning of September... the week before the murder.",
            "White: I had entered the Fey & Co. Law Offices.",
            "White: Of course, I had done so to place the wiretap.",
            "White: That is when I saw this glass light stand.",
            "Judge: Hmm... So, you saw the stand before the night of the incident... And this is how you were able to identify what had fallen over. By the sound?",
            "White: Correct! That is right.",
            "Judge: I see. Very well, Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine.",
            "Edgeworth: Tsk tsk. I'm afraid that's as far as you go, Mr. Wright. The time has come for you to admit your defeat! You fought... honorably.",
            "Phoenix: (No more... I can't take this anymore...)",
            "Judge: Mr. Wright? Are you giving up?",

            "Mia: Ah, you're finally awake.",

            "Mia: Didn't you know the Fey women have strong psychic powers...? ",
            "Mia: When you accepted your defeat in court... It appears that was enough of a shock to awaken Maya's true powers.",
            "Phoenix: So... Maya is channeling you, Mia?",
            "Mia: That's right. I am Maya, but I'm also Mia. ",
            "Mia: Now, I want you to listen to me, Phoenix.",
            "Mia: Maya never gave up. You can't either!",
            "Mia: That's what I came here to tell you.",

            "Mia: You've already won.",
            "Phoenix: Huh...?",
            "Mia: You have that Receipt in the court record, right?",
            "Phoenix: Um... oh, yeah! The one you wrote \"Maya\" on...?",
            "Mia: Phoenix! White wrote that, not me!",
            "Phoenix: So... so what do I do with it?",
            "Mia: Look at the front of the receipt!",
            "Phoenix: The... front?",
            "Phoenix: (It's a regular receipt... Looks like it's from a famous department store. ",
            "Phoenix: \"$1,000.00\"... Wow, big spender!",
