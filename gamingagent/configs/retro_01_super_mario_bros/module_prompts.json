Use short sequences to prepare, then commit to a jump\n- Enemies: Jump over enemies when close. If unsure, move back or jump in place\n- Speed management: Don't rush as unseen enemies may appear from off-screen\n- Close-range obstacles: Use [right_a] instead of [right_a_b] when Mario is very close to pipes or obstacles, as running jumps need run-up space to build speed and vertical clearance\n- Getting unstuck: If Mario is stuck and can't jump over a pipe, use [right_a] 30 or [right_a_b] 30 with maximum frames to build enough momentum and height\n- Approaching gaps (detailed): Be extremely cautious. Use short sequences first to prepare positioning (e.g., 5-10 frames), then commit to a jump with enough momentum (20-30 frames for large gaps)\n- Enemies (detailed): Use defensive jumps when enemies are near. Goombas can be jumped on, Koopas require more caution. If unsure about timing, move back or jump in place\n- Obstacles: Predict what's coming and prepare actions accordingly. Tall pipes may require high jumps with running momentum\n- Defensive play: When in doubt, take a defensive approach (move left, jump in place, or use noop to observe)\n- Momentum for jumps: Running jumps ([right_a_b]) travel much farther than regular jumps ([right_a])\n- Player state awareness: If Mario appears to be falling or in an unstable state, use [noop] briefly to let him stabilize\n\nTactical Examples:\n- Small gap ahead: move: (right_a, 12) - Standard jump should clear it\n- Large gap or pit: move: (right_a_b, 25) - Need running momentum for distance\n- Enemy very close: move: (a, 5) - Jump in place to avoid/defeat it\n- Multiple enemies clustered: move: (left, 8) - Retreat to safer position\n- Tall pipe obstacle: move: (right_a_b, 30) - Maximum momentum for height and distance\n- Mario falling/unstable: move: (noop, 5) - Let him stabilize before next action\n- Uncertain situation: move: (right, 10) - Cautious forward progress to assess\n\nBased on the current game state in the image, what action should Mario take next?\nResponse format:\nthought: [your analysis here - consider Mario's position, immediate threats, obstacles ahead, momentum needs, and frame count justification]\nmove: (action_name_from_list, frame_count)"
