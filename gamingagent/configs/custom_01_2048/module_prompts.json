        "prompt": "Your task is to generate a pixel-accurate visualization of a 4x4 game board, given a matrix of tile powers.\nEach cell in the matrix represents the power of 2 at that position (e.g., a value of 1 means 2^1 = 2, 0 means empty tile).\n\nFollow these instructions carefully:\n\n1. The canvas should be a square image (default 400x400 pixels) with a light beige background (RGB: 250, 248, 239).\n2. Divide the canvas into a 4x4 grid. Each tile is a square with uniform padding between them.\n3. For each tile:\n   - Compute the actual number as `2^power`. A 0 means the tile is empty.\n   - Use the following color mapping (RGB):\n     - 0: (205, 193, 180)\n     - 2: (238, 228, 218)\n     - 4: (237, 224, 200)\n     - 8: (242, 177, 121)\n     - 16: (245, 149, 99)\n     - 32: (246, 124, 95)\n     - 64: (246, 94, 59)\n     - 128: (237, 207, 114)\n     - 256: (237, 204, 97)\n     - 512: (237, 200, 80)\n     - 1024: (237, 197, 63)\n     - 2048: (237, 194, 46)\n     - For values > 2048, use a fallback color (60, 58, 50)\n4. Draw each tile as a rounded square (or rectangle) with its corresponding fill color.\n5. If the tile is non-empty, render the numeric value centered inside the tile:\n   - Use a clean, legible font.\n   - Text color should be:\n     - (119, 110, 101) for values <= 4\n     - (249, 246, 242) for values > 4\n   - Make sure the text is visually centered.\n6. Save the resulting image to the provided path.\n\nDo not apply interpretation, filtering, or compression — faithfully render the matrix as a visual 2048 game board.\nYou should aim for pixel-level accuracy and aesthetic consistency with the official 2048 game look.\n\nExample input:\n```\n[[0, 1, 2, 3],\n [0, 0, 1, 4],\n [0, 2, 3, 0],\n [5, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nExpected output: An image with correct tile values and colors positioned on a grid layout as described above.\n",

Build a stable structure - Keep your highest value tiles in a corner.\n2. Maintain a clear path - Always have a direction where you can combine tiles.\n3. Chain reactions - Set up sequences of merges that can happen in a single move.\n4. Look ahead - Think about the consequences of your moves 2-3 steps ahead.\n5. Building patterns - Common patterns include:\n   - Snake/Zig-zag pattern: Arrange tiles in decreasing order in a zigzag.\n   - Corner anchoring: Keep the highest tile in a corner and build around it.\n6. If a move leaves the board unchanged (no tiles move or merge), you must pick a different direction that results in an actual change to keep the game progressing.\n\nAvoid:\n- Getting high-value tiles stuck in the middle of the board\n- Creating scattered small values that block potential merges\n- Making moves that could lead to grid lock\n\nYour response format should contain:\n1. thought: [Your reasoning about the game state and planned action]\n2. move: [move]\n\nExample responses:\n- thought: I see several opportunities to merge tiles.
