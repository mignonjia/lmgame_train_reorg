Your task is to reflect on the current game state and provide insights.\n\nPrevious Context (older → newer):\n{prev_context}\n\nCurrent Observation:\n{current_observation}\n\nPlease provide a reflection on the current game state. Consider:\n1. What significant events or progress have occurred since previous states?\n2. Was the last action and thought process effective for Pokemon Red gameplay?\n3. What important game elements need attention (Pokemon party, items, location, objectives)?\n4. Any strategic insights for future actions (exploration, battles, progression)?\n5. Key information from NPCs, signs, or dialog that should be remembered?\n\nIMPORTANT GAMEPLAY GUIDANCE:\n- Navigation: Use the collision map as your primary navigation guide. Look for unexplored areas (marked as 'CHECK HERE' or '··') rather than revisiting explored tiles (marked as 'xx' or 'EXPLORED')\n- Maze Navigation: In complex areas like caves or buildings, prioritize avoiding EXPLORED tiles over going in the 'correct' direction. Sometimes you need to go south to eventually reach north. Use depth-first search principles.\n- Dead Ends: If you discover a dead end in a maze, consider labeling it clearly to avoid repeated visits\n- Coordinate System: Remember that (0,0) is the top-left corner of the map. Movement is tracked in (column, row) format\n- Location Labels: If map labels seem incorrect or unhelpful, strongly consider updating them with more accurate descriptions\n- Stuck Detection: If you're repeatedly visiting the same locations without progress, actively seek unexplored areas or different routes\n- Game Knowledge: Question assumptions that seem to violate Pokemon Red game mechanics. The game follows specific rules and progression paths\n- Dialog and NPCs: Pay careful attention to NPC conversations, signs, and story elements as they often provide crucial progression hints\n- Resource Management: Monitor Pokemon health, PP, items, and money regularly for strategic planning\n- Progression Blockers: Identify what's preventing progress (need specific items, Pokemon, badges, story events) and plan accordingly\n\nReflection:",

If `processed_visual_description` is available and contains structured data (e.g., \"player_location\", \"dialog_text\", \"menu_state\", \"battle_info\"), prioritize using these fields for your analysis.\n2. If `processed_visual_description` is not available or lacks detail, use `textual_representation`. This typically includes:\n    - Player name, rival name, and current location\n    - Player coordinates and valid moves\n    - Pokemon party information (species, levels, HP, moves)\n    - Inventory items and quantities\n    - Current dialog or menu text\n    - Badge collection status\n3.

Always explore these first.\n2. **Follow Step Distances**: Move toward tiles with decreasing \"StepsToReach\" numbers to efficiently navigate to your target.\n3. **Avoid Backtracking**: Unless absolutely necessary, avoid \"Explored\" tiles in favor of unvisited areas.\n4. **Exit Strategy**: In mazes (caves, buildings), systematically explore all \"Check here\" areas to find the way out or forward.\n5. **Dead End Detection**: If you reach an area with no \"Check here\" tiles and only \"Explored\" or \"Impassable\" tiles, backtrack to find alternative routes.\n6. **Coordinate Planning**: Use the exact coordinates to plan efficient paths and avoid getting lost.\n\n**Effective Maze Navigation**:\n- When stuck or lost, look for the nearest \"Check here\" tile with a reasonable StepsToReach value\n- In complex cave systems, methodically visit every \"Check here\" area before concluding you're stuck\n- Remember that exits are often hidden in unexplored corners or branches\n- If you see multiple \"Check here\" options, choose the one with the lowest StepsToReach first\n\nGame State Recognition:\n- **Overworld/Field**: You can move around, interact with objects/NPCs. Use directional buttons to explore, 'a' to interact.\n- **Dialog**: Text is being displayed. Use 'a' to advance, sometimes 'b' to go back or cancel.\n- **Menu**: You're in a menu system. Use directional buttons to navigate, 'a' to select, 'b' to go back.\n- **Battle**: You're in a Pokemon battle. Navigate battle menus with directions, select with 'a'.\n- **Title Screen**: Game startup screen.
